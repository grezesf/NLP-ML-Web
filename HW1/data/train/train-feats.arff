at first but in the end this game was amazing besides the earlier game the unwound future this is my favorite ds game Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful EFYevan 10 Fantastic This whole series is the best of the Nintendo DS I recommend this game to everyone You won t regret this purchase even if you haven t played any of the other 4 in the series before this one The puzzles are the best in the business Plus as a bonus you get one puzzle download a day for the next 365 days 150 365 515 puzzles total by October 28 2013 A 10 10 Expand 8 of 8 users found this helpful Bennie 10 I like this Professor Layton sequel very much There are around 150 puzzles to solve in the game itself but with the download option you can also download more puzzles Other than the other Professor Layton series the graphics are 3D and 2D Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful TheBlueBadger 10 While Lost Future still contains my favourite story Miracle Mask definitely has the best gameplay in a Layton game to date I go to explore these underground ruins expecting it to be a series of doors locked by puzzles and the game actually turns into a dungeon crawler while still maintaining the Layton style of using your brain to get through The game s villain escapes being pursued by Layton and co on horseback and you actually get to control this section and give chase The new 3D puzzles are all excellent uses of what the 3DS can do The story is incredibly interesting miles better than Spector s call which is an achievement telling the story of how Layton lost his best friend in the past and at the same time showing us this beautiful city being under constant attacks by the masked gentleman and his miracles Seeing the two timelines intersect made for some really good storytelling I d definitely recommend this Expand 2 of 2 users found this helpful lbaeriswyl 10 Great Music Puzzles and Story so anybody who enjoys this kind of game will have a top notch dose of entertainment Returning fans can expect more of the same shaken up by a whole new top down puzzle section that involves evading mummies and boulder puzzles The Story is a tease even though it s technically finished in itself it sets up the last game perfectly Expand 4 of 4 users found this helpful Wheezy247 9 I was a bit worried when Level 5 said they were bringing the Professor Layton series to the 3DS because I wasn t sure how well the 3D would be utilized for a typically beautiful 2D game Well despite my worries Level 5 manages to create an experience that wouldn t be the same on the standard Nintendo DS The use of 3D models though a bit odd at first really works nicely with the art style Even the cutscenes which are typically in their standard 2D format pop out and really add a sense of depth with the 3D slider on The music is beautiful and like always really adds a feel to each area you encounter There isn t much that has changed about the gameplay from the previous entries in the series you go around solving puzzles in order to uncover a huge mystery It will feel really familiar to veterans of the series Also don t go in expecting much to change with the gameplay because it hasn t There are a few minigames of sorts that use the touch screen but are rare and nothing spectacular The real appeal to this game is the fact that fans will get a deeper look into Layton s history The game switches between the present day problem and a series of events that occurred 18 years prior The flow was never really an issue except I wasn t a huge fan of Chapter 6 I won t spoil anything about it other than it sort of breaks up the flow of the game in my opinion Other than that the story is wonderfully told and the ending will have you begging to play the last entry Outside of the main game you have the minigames that are in your trunk and though I never got particularly into them they do add some more gameplay Also as in previous games there are outside puzzles that you can unlock after you complete the game Plus Nintendo is releasing puzzles every day for a whole year This adds up to enough gameplay to make this game well worth your money Now an issue I could see with the game is that it doesn t do a great job explaining what happened previously which could be good if you want to play the others in the franchise making it difficult for new players to fully appreciate Layton and Luke However all in all this game is an excellent addition to your 3DS collection and a must play for any Professor Layton fan 9 10 Expand 2 of 2 users found this helpful TheJeffness 8 CRUMPETS AND

the floor Once they meet up with three of their own color all the action starts to happen Clear the board of all the snoods in classic time limits and playmodes and test your skill literally on the edge No more snoods available What do we do now We fire a grappling hook to hook the snoods and pull them back to snood central Then fire them to where we want them to be to make them fall from the board Sounds simple BUT watch out If you leave a poor snood by itself you will never finish the game Circular snood has got me in a spin Fire the snoods up to the highest levels of gameplay Watch out there are no straight sides to bounce off You are in a circular tube and the snoods will bounce and fly everywhere if your angles are wrong Just when you think you have the game beaten the whole world

you ll assume the role of an animal in its early stages of development From the moment the game begins your creature is on its own to fend for its life As your animal instincts take over you will boldly traverse hostile environments savagely stalking your prey and asserting your place in the animal chain of power Explore a number of different environments while consuming other animals in order to evolve into one of 100 possible creature combinations Ultimately the goal is to become powerful enough to topple the alpha creature and earn your rightful place at the top of the food chain Expand

game market continues to be filled with remakes and ripoffs Because of this it seems truly special when something crazy unique comes along Enter Cubivore The game plays like some strange survival game with RPG elements You play a cube whose dream is to become the top predator by eating just about everything that moves From start to finish this is all you do eat evolve eat evolve As you eat you gain limbs and with different colored limbs comes different combinations The goal being to play through the game until you ve got 100 different combinations Essentially its a simple game but its given more depth through the games fascinating personality Every night your cubivore writes in its diary it sounds cheesier than it actually is and the game uses this to comment on the idea of competition and killing things to live Over all its a one of a kind experience that really should be shared with modern audiences Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful Fragasnap 6 Cubivore Survival of the Fittest is certainly one of the more unusual games one will encounter The purpose is to become King of the Cubivores by assuming as many different mutations as possible by strategically eating the colored slabs of meat off of other Cubivores Ultimately this is an unfortunately linear rather repetitious but painfully quirky game A gamer with a penchant for the unusual will be able to look past Cubivore s short comings but passive curiosity won t carry through to the end Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful See all 11 User Reviews var nr domain www metacritic com var nrelate dwparams mapp nrelate

requiring extremely tight timing to escape certain doom A dozen GameCenter achievements are available for a bit of replay value and there is even an achievement for completing the game in one sitting with 5 or fewer deaths which can be a pretty daunting challenge This was our first experience with LIMBO and we were pretty blown away All this publication s reviews Read full review Slide to Play Jul 3 2013 100 Limbo for iOS is a fantastic port of a classic indie platformer All this publication s reviews Read full review ImpulsegamerJul 11 2013 95 Limbo has made the leap to iOS admirably losing nothing in the translation and only minor quibbles with the jumping mechanics really stand out enough to drop the score slightly Indeed Limbo is surprisingly well suited to the sporadic habits of the handheld gamer with well thought out checkpoint placement allowing you to tackle a few quick puzzles at your leisure whenever you have a spare minute or three and the spine tingling aesthetic of the game benefits greatly from the intimate nature of handheld gaming All this publication s reviews Read full review ModojoJul 3 2013 90 Is this touchscreen Limbo a perfect port of the original masterpiece Not quite and there are certainly moments where you ll cry out for the precision that only a physical controller can provide Still these moments are rare enough to ensure that this mobile version remains nothing less than outstanding overall All this publication s reviews Read full review Apple N AppsJul 5 2013 90 Limbo is a benefit to the entire App Store that is a spectacular

the less recommendable version of them all All this publication s reviews Read full review TouchArcadeJul 11 2013 60 Limbo s soft focus monochrome promises mystery and dread but it s undercut by the

Negative 0 out of 5 DanielPrce 10 Great art style fun puzzles challenging rewarding entertaining mysterious The perfect adventure indie game only problem that i have is that it s too short but i feel it would have gotten repetitive anyways This game is a must buy if you own an Xbox or Ps3 and enjoy great games Expand 1 of 3 users found this helpful sisterearth 10 This is a fascinating game Of course my grandson figured out more than I could The only problem is that it takes so much concentration that it gave me a headache Expand 1 of 3 users found this helpful Repelstale 9 Limbo is the kind of game that s just perfect for mobile devices It s perfectly playable in small chunks but has this just one more level edge to it as well I ve never played it on other devices but I can t imagine better highly intuitive controls than the touch controls that are used here If you re considering getting this game but are a little uncertain because of some reviews saying the controls are imprecise don t be As for the often mentioned high difficulty and frustration level I seriously don t know what they re talking about The game is certainly challenging but with a little perseverance and some wit it s very beatable indeed Death is frequent and there s a lot of trial and error but that s just how this game tests your intellect Failure is never cheap and never the result of impossibly sharp timing I m not an avid platform gamer I actually shy away from anything that involves too much fast finger action but even I could handle these challenges Maybe it s because I grew up in an age of games where limited restarts where a rule yes I m that old but the fact that Limbo picks up the game again just a couple of seconds before your demise and lets you do so infinitely feels very forgiving to me Add to that a highly engrossing atmosphere very inventive and varied puzzles a great physics engine just the right kind of morbid humor and just the perfect game length and you ve got one hell or should I say purgatory of a game Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Caccia 8 The game is designed around trial and error gameplay with failed attempts resulting in gruesome deaths in fact the developers call it triaial and death game play AppsGoer s review is right on time and superb on ideas Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful tsabszy 8 The idea visual look feeling mood atmosphere are perfect This game is pure genius The reason it doesn t deserve more than 8 is because the game play is too frustrating I couldn t play it trough and not because it s too hard rather because you die a lot of times during a play trough and every time you need to wait for 10 seconds or more and it gets way too frustrated after you had died a hundred times it means you had lost hours from your lifetime not playing just watching your character die and a black screen If every time I die I could just skip that unnecessary procedure by hitting an Escape or Space or Enter I would give it a 9 10 Expand 2 of 3 users found this helpful Related Articles iPhone Games 10 Best iPhone iPad Games for July 2013 Published July 31 2013 Looking for a few new time wasters or something more

similar to Tetris Attack is more like a step up from Yoshi Pandepon Sure the graphics are all Pok eacut e mon instead of Yoshi but that makes the game a bit brighter Tetris Attack used mostly pastels but this game is bolder colorwise Also the 3D mode is a challenge for even Tetris Attack masters The opponents in Puzzle League are a bit harder and the speeds are a bit faster and the music is great There are lots of play areas Marathon Time Zone Spa Service to name a few and a lot of the Pok mon characters made it into the game which is nice I d say the only flaw is in the new 3D mode From time to time it will whip you around to another part of the screen Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful MichaelL 9 I love this game It s really great Sorry for my mistakes with the language but I m German Pok mon Puzzle League is the best game I ve ever played It s even better than Tetris Attack because of two new things 1 The 3D Mode You have to know I do always play TimeTrial Mode because I thing it s more just 2 The possibility to make longer chains than x13 Tetris Attack In Tetris Attack you had to finish your chain after x13 because you didn t earn more points Now you can get much longer chains One time Time Trial Mode 3D Level 1 I made 91214 points because of this new possibility The only thing which is not very good is When your playing 2 Player Mode Time Trial 3D Level 1 it can often be that the game begins to run much slower when both players have very fast and long chains o K this is all I wanted to say bye lederichbiker web de Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Glitter 8 Tetris on steroids Pok mon Snap is a one dimensional RPG in a wonderland of puzzlement Despite the trivial and rather niche gameplay it is addictive in offering a variety of play styles Remaining fresh through each new advancement the game maintains a outflow of entertainment simply through stacking and matching blocks Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Anonymous 5 1 player mode is fun for awhile but after playing for days even the computer on its Super Hard level becomes easy Also this is almost exactly like Tetris Attack which I had the happened to own for some time Basically the original is better then the newer game since it was superb for its time and it isn t a clone like this one is Don t get me wrong I still play it but when you are facing the extra levels like Butch and Cassidy everything that I noticed was the same as Tetris Attack 2 Player mode is the only time you get to pick the trainer of your choice and that makes it hard if you try to pick which trainer you like most The only reason I play 2 player is because of the much needed cpu control of player two Create a puzzle has been done in other tetris games like tetris attack and even that won t hook people for too long Overall I think that once you become a master at the game you possibly will never play it again Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful See all 10 User Reviews var nr domain

girlfriends because of my food habits but I do not care The fact is this game makes me feel like I have friends The graphics are just excellent and like I said a million times it reminds me of food but we really can t afford that much food cause I eat all of it so my advice is rent this game grab some junk food and play the game I give this game a 10 because this is a knockout game the best game ever but most of all those pink fat guys because they remind me of me that I would like to eat cookie and cream they are soo cute hehe Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful TheTalkingSandwich 9 The

recommend playing it two player as it s pretty clear that was the way developers intended it to be Me and my girlfriend had a blast with it Some seriously innovative and fun gamepad usage Can t fault it The controls are great and it s really really fun A shining example of what can be done with the gamepad in the right hands Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Weeblo 10 This game is really fun I love the Murfy stages where you are forced to use the gamepad s touchscreen and motion controls It is simply fun The game reminds me of Mario 64 and it is awesome The graphics are phenomenal and the game is super fun It is fast and slow based on what you need to accomplish but it is always a thrill Ubisoft did a great job developing this game and it takes advantage of the Wii U s gamepad perfectly Great game Definitely a must buy for gamers of all types Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful RateU4Fun 10 Simply amazing Rayman Origins was one of my favorite platformers of this gen and Legends found a way to completely improve upon it without creating any new problems The more music levels is simply the greatest thing Ubisoft could have done with this game A must buy Expand 8 of 8

frugal frogger 10 Previous fans you should like the series even more because of this and no more Rabbids Yes Not previous fans this game will knock your socks off Expand 3 of 3 users found this helpful PuckMan 9 Rayman Legends is the first must own Wii U game and the first game to use the gamepad well The core game play is the same as in Origins but everything has been improved from the level design boss fights online features and most importantly the amount of variety Origins was a good game but it got repetitive well before the end Legends manages to keep things fresh through out thanks largely to the new rhythm action levels and daily online challenges and leader boards The musical rhythm action levels are the best thing about Legends and really it s a shame there weren t more of these types of stages Some sections require touch screen and tilt controls there not particularly innovative but they are at least well implemented and add a bit more variety but if I m being honest I still could have done without them It seems churlish of me I know to criticise the game for having too much content but many of the old levels from Origins are included as part of the main game and I felt that this made the game more repetitive than it needed to be as the new levels already have a lot of replay ability and will take a very long time to master them and unlock everything Bogging the game down with old content just seems unnecessary Generous yes but unnecessary In terms of graphics and music Rayman Legends is one of the best games you can get and it makes New Super Mario Bros U seem bland in comparison I still prefer the less floaty physics and more tactical gameplay in New Super Mario Bros U though which makes picking which is better less clear cut than it could have been Overall though I d have to say the feature packed Rayman Legends is the best HD platform game there currently is Expand 2 of 4 users found this helpful See all 19 User Reviews Trailers

functionality are greatly appreciated The gameplay is timeless and the game features one of the best Zelda storylines Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful Aerokii 10 When I initially saw videos of the game especially in comparison to the original I hated it Everything looked too soft too bloomed too foggy all the colors that made the original different and fun seemed gone After starting the game I immediately knew I d never trust another review like that again The colors are all there and absolutely stunning when playing on the TV They re still there on the gamepad but there are small differences that can be attributed to your individual TV settings To say the game is gorgeous is an understatement You get all the things that made the original stylistically great but even better vibrant colors smooth and crisp lines entities sound and music that always fit the mood and incredibly expressive characters Link in particular make this possibly the most personable and charming of the console games The gameplay s as solid now as it ever has been but the more recent tweaks included really spice things up Travel over water is now much faster and the ocean feels far less empty For the dungeons puzzles and combat not much has changed but that s a good thing What has changed MOST though is the interface and controls At first I was sort of worried about the Wii U game pad it looked so big and clunky but after using it for 10 minutes I fell in love and that was just for browsing Wii U menus Using it in game is a real treat You have easy access to the map and item screens without ever needing to pause or wait and the drag and drop for items is splendid The controller feels right in the hands it fits well and is quite light This ties nicely into an addition they added the 3DS and that s motion based controllers for first person views Want to take a picture Activate your pictograph box and hold up your game pad It will move with you which is even more impressive when you re playing with the game pad only It ties into item use as well such as the grappling hook and others and feels much faster than regular thumb use The only thing missing is the ability to connect a wii remote and use it as the Wind Waker baton This game is everything I wanted it to be a direct improvement and complete remastering of the original that takes full advantage of what makes the Wii U great It s sold me on the console s abilities and brought me back to a delightful childhood memory that seems even better the second time around This game is a must buy for all Legend of Zelda fans and all those who love good old fashioned ADVENTURE Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful sslevanderbilt 10 The original was amazing and was filled with so much adventure The same is true

scientist who always seems to make backfiring inventions He turns his pet cat into a potted cactus so of course the logical fix is to go back in time and prevent himself from making that mistake again There are a few quirks in the controls building machines could be a bit smoother and the Doc is a very fragile being but all in all I think for an indie developer they ve done a pretty good job The art style is lively and colorful which should appeal to younger audiences it s the game encourages logical thinking to solve puzzles as well as constructive thinking when building inventions out of objects littered around the landscape The humor is great as the Doc s robot backpack constantly ridicules his partner while the Doc seems to have rather a Mr Bean demeanor completely oblivious to the negativity Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful var nr domain www metacritic com var nrelate dwparams mapp nrelate comptype widget comp 380 riaevent view s6 document location href s7 US google ad

out of 8 Noodlemanny 10 This is not the sort of game that you d buy as a stand alone title or fun it is nothing without the dead space games and there is little fun to be had within it There is little actual game play and of this there is little variation The story line is OK but is a bit annoying as certain fates of characters are unavoidable no matter what story path you take of which there are four The game literately only consists of three different hacking type mini games which have all been done before and cut scenes that are just moving drawings with audio The ONLY reason anyone should EVER buy this is to get some back story from the Dead Space universe a little tiny kick before the main event that is dead space 2 comes out If your a fan of dead space and like to see a little more like the movies and comics then sure get it if your really want to It won t last long it won t be overly interesting and could leave a slightly bitter taste in your mouth but hey its only a fiver Expand 1 of 6 users found this helpful freestar76 10 Just not all that exciting There s a few hacking mini games in there that pose a challenge but the whole package just isn t worth it It s just so far away from the original Dead Space game that a lot of people just own t get it Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful UncleChandy 9 Once I realised that this isn t really a game and its just some extra background fluff I actually found myself able to enjoy this game It s definitely not a game more of an interactive comic The art style of the comics is fairly poor it has to be said but I found I was able to forget it once I started to get into the story I maybe owe a debt of gratitude to the many people who had lowered my expectations enough tht I was actually pleasantly surprised Not bad for free I think Not brilliant but not bad Expand 1 of 3 users found this helpful Larux18 6 This game is not really a game its a pretty well made and enjoyable comic actually if this would just had been the comic it would have been great I would have given a higher score but its because of the stupid puzzles that this game is kind of ruined It seems to me this is like ruined potential when it came to gameplay since the puzzles get horrifyingly hard near the end If they would have made longer the comics and make it have a little bit more story then I would be fine In fact I would be quite pleased to give 5 its just the stupid mini games that ruin everything This game CAN be considered only if you are interested in a little story in an interactive comic but the gameplay is just ill admit So think before buying this game Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful SUPERFLY 3 Almost total rubbish A game is released that you really enjoy Dead Space 2 and you hear that there is a tie in game that has a main game reward attached to it so what do you do Like the chump EA knows you are you spend your Microsoft points on this piece of useless trash I hate myself for buying this game and trust me you ll feel the same way Don t do it It s totally shameless exploitation and manipulation on the part of EA I paid full price for Dead Space 2 and there is absolutely no justification for the content available for completing Ignition not being available in the main game already Some people may feel I m unfairly picking on EA over this but quite honestly I feel that they are the worst offenders with this kind of thing Anyway that s my rant finished Trust me this game is not good Feel free to find out for yourself though Expand 2 of 2 users found this helpful peoplewhomatter 0 a friend told me to try this game i am never going to listen to him again this is by far the worst dead space ever don t waste your time or money on this game it s simply not worth it the gmeplay and the controls are terrible Expand 1 of 3 users found this helpful kobra sxi 0 The most pointless waste of money i have every spent plot is awful the comic visuals are badly drawn and the small amount

that changed the world of gaming Great game Expand 1 of 2 users found this helpful MuXu 10 This game deserves a better user score I hope nobody takes it serious because there are a lot of butthurt fakevotes Well to the game This is the GTA you ve always been waiting for Yes it s true You loved San Andreas because of gameplay You loved Vice City because of music and atmosphere GTA 3 s innovation GTA IV s story Well I ll explain This GTA brings it all together The playing of three characters at once goes really smooth it feels just how it should be shooting and driving is really fun it s kinda a mix between the realistic driving in GTA IV arcade driving in Midnight Club and shooting from Max Payne 3 and this is perfect The missions are fun again many people thought GTA IV had too similar missions and I thought so too but now you ll never get bored I assure you The story is really well written won t write more about that cause there is a lot to spoiler The world is really massive the countryside isn t boring at all and seriously who wasn t missing that after GTA IV I don t know how R did this but even the graphics improved while the game is bigger over all You can do so much stuff in Los Santos and it s countryside it s unbelievable that it is just one game I played for at least 20 hours now and I have so much more to see and explore just crazy Well what else can I say Buy it Play it yourself and agree It s a really good game Expand 127 of 189 users found this helpful RoverTookOver84 10 One of the things that becomes obvious when you actually stop playing a great game is that you just lost some conception of time and awareness of the external world at some level and became fully engrossed The better the game the greater the level of immersion GTA V is the most immersive and engrossing game I have ever played on all levels It reminds me of the hours and hours I spent just aimlessly driving in Vice City and San Andreas I can finally do that again while doing so much more in a more fully alive and beautifully realized world This is a must buy must have and a must play Now if only GTA V would come to PS4 and Xbone Expand 2 of 3 users found this helpful jhonjoyojnohjn 10 If you re worried that this might be another over hyped release of a sub par product coasting on the success of its big name predecessors as is all too common these days you can rest easy if you like any of the previous GTAs you will love this It has everything it should and more taking the best elements of the core mechanics and plot from GTA 4 and re adding and improving further the vast array of peripheral activities and huge non linear world to get lost in And if you re new to the series this is a great game in its own right At it s core it s just really fun to play whether you re driving around the countryside aimlessly or getting sucked into one of the many varied plot strands All of the mechanics and graphics have been polished to death I actually can t imagine a game looking better on the Xbox and the physics feel like a hyper fun version of reality which is exactly as it should be It s super accessible with just the right dash of realism to keep it grounded There are too many features and improvements to describe in full here but in a nutshell Really fun core mechanics Gorgeous huge painstakingly crafted world to explore Absorbing plots and varied missions Ridiculous number of sub games tasks and activities woven seamlessly into the core game Genuinely funny satirical undertone to everything At time of posting this has a user score of 8 0 which is criminally low for a game which is about as good as I can imagine there being on the Xbox Wanting a PC release because you know this is a good game is not a reason to give this 0 10 in the Xbox

boring and tedious grind unless you pay real money for fake game cash to cut down on the boring grind In game assets intentionally overpriced That s what you get when you include microtransactions in a game This game could be the best game ever made if it wasn t designed to rip people off Expand 0 of 10 users found this helpful See all 409 User Reviews Trailers GTA V Official Story Trailer Play

simulation kick ass graphics and music that compliments it all This game will give you hours of pure fun and the SplatterTV feature will let you see playbacks of top players doesn t mean you can mimic what they are doing right away but it will let you see what is possible its a puzzle that requires skills to complete It might seem like Peggle at first glimpse but once you dig into it you will realize there is hardly any luck there its 99 skills and skills take little bit of time to develop the game features 3 themes become a talent which teaches you the basic skills Master shots that shows you how to efficiently use those skills in a single shot game mode and combo nation which puts everything you learned together this mode puts you in the zone when shooting for 3 stars you will need to use everything you learned and do it fast enough so the combo doesn t drop you can clear a level scoring 20 000 pts or 20 000 000 pts its all about your skills with the integration of leader boards with clip playback the reply value is enormous every time you think you did well on a level you can see someone else that did twice as good giving you something to strive for because its so unique its hard to describe it in words so you simply have to try it yourself At 800 points its a bargain Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful MegWhiteley 9 The Splatters wow really incredible game is funny interesting addictive with great gameplay this title is amazing have much great points The Splatters is a new classic Expand 0 of 2 users found this helpful ZivOs97 9 I was actually surprised This is the first israeli XBOX game and it is actually good Way to go Spikey Snail Great Puzzles and awesome graphics 0 of 0 users found this helpful Darkholegames 8 The Splatters is a fun mind puzzle game The objective is to complete each stage by sending your colored explosive paint like blobs into certain objects that are placed throughout the map The Splatters is a Xbox Live Arcade game made by SpikySnail You can purchase this game off the Xbox Live Arcade Marketplace for just 800MSP 10 00 Lets break down this game full of craziness Gameplay Stages Each stage has more than one round At the beginning of each stage you will be presented with instructions on how to play that current stage During each of the rounds the objects on the stage will change If you are to unable to clear the stage you will be presented with a cheat sheet It will show you exactly how to pass the level TIP using the level is key Controls The controls are very simple You use your L analog stick to control which way the yellow arrow points The yellow arrow is like your guide to where you want the blob to go Next you use the A button to power up and release your blob and watch it splatter all over the stage in many awesome ways Characters Blobs Each round and stage has different color blobs that are always smiling They show no fear haha Abilities During certain stages you will be introduced to new and challenging ways to complete the stage For example Air Strike This is where you direct your yellow arrow where you want to go hit A then hit A again while directing the second yellow arrow to a new direction but you have to it in a split second and at the right moment otherwise you fail and have to try again Yeah it gets much harder as you progress haha Design Levels The design starts out very simple and slightly get a little harder What really makes them challenging is the content within and the abilities you are given for that current stage Interface Very simple concept You have your main screen which shows your score and next to that is your combo multiplayer See simple Abilities I know we touched this aspect before but the idea behind giving the blobs abilities is pure genius It brings a real challenge to the game and makes the player use their mind It is also fun to just play around with the ability on certain stages and not care to complete the level because you get to see your blob do funny movements Overview This game is pure genius worth every penny is a 9 10 If your looking for a family friendly mind puzzle time killing game gasm then this is your game No game or level will ever play the same and you are offered so much in the full game version I highly recommend you purchase this game because you will never want to stop playing I promise you SpikySnail did an amazing job on this and I hope to see more of their work in the future Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Xborn74 8 The Splatters is an XBLA game developed by SpikySnail Games and produced by Microsft which costs 800ms points The game is very reminiscent of a classic and popular game Peggle mixed with the new games that deal with physical being a good and addictive game option you use gelatinous creatures that are thrown being slip and spilled into the structures of the stages to clear of them of bombs Particularly in everything from gameplay and presentation to the general structure of the menus reminded me of one more game for iPhone iPhone and other derivatives than consoles themselves though it can play perfectly on them The game musics are lively made with synthesizers much like Peggle in this aspect the way they are made and themselves but without the music by Beethoven the sounds are well done too with creatures shouting happily to be thrown among funny noises The game features graphics and graphical effects like slow motion very similar to Peggle too the details in the graphics are in the structures mostly in front of the screen while the backgrounds have a blurry look It is also nice to see an effect of fragmentation on the bombs after destroying them which seems fine glitter in the screen Although not spectacular graphically the foundations of the game are in the gameplay which makes it a great casual puzzle action game you use a virtual slingshot which is used with the analog stick to aim and throw the creatures according with force that you determine by the time you press the A in the controller More ahead of the game the creatures develop new powers to diversify what we can do besides throw them such as changing the gravity and rewind time as well as having special maneuvers such as changing the direction of your motion reverse the direction in which all fly in the screen etc and everything counts to perform combos that increase the final score just like hitting two different sets of pumps with the same gelatin At the end of each stage you are graded according to your performance points from 1 to 3 stars and these grades will release new stages and characters features to play all account for achieving this as special maneuvers and combos performed as well as how many golden gelatin s you catch while you slide and fly in the scenario which is limited to the same screen The big problem is that the game after a while ends up being repetitive because the action comes down to the same thing just changing the stages and game modes although having new abilities to use in the cleared stages to get the maximum score Nevertheless it s a nice choice for a puzzle game my score is 8 3 10 0 Expand 3 of 3 users found this helpful electriclight41 8 Featuring elements from different puzzles games like Peggle and Angry Birds The Splatters is a fun and unique diversion It s easy to pick up and play a couple quick puzzles or you can focus on conquering a series of harder ones The momentum changing mechanic is an interesting way to solve stages though some are frustrating Once you do beat them they re satisfying Definitely worth downloading Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Trailers The Splatters Reviews Are Here Trailer Play Video 1 49 0 views play now The Splatters Launch Trailer Play

provocative 127 hours is probably the best movie of the year James Franco gives a tour de force performance and Danny Boyle offers the perfect amount of kinetic energy to compliment the harrowing story However the humanity and bravery of Ralston are never lost within the hyper active scenes nor are they over the top in the reflective ones Boyle has crafted a visually stunning gut wrenchingly visceral and unforgettable movie I m sure this story of human strength against all the odds will continue to inspire and entertain for years Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful JackScribe 10 RyanGee and many reviewers have pinpointed the reason this film will be so successful and a contender for the Oscars Add equal parts of Danny Boyle s energetic concept cinematography editing and

distribution Positive 1 out of 3 Mixed 1 out of 3 Negative 1 out of 3 Dreskar 6 I am giving it a 6 mainly because the movie is rather enjoyable especially if you are interested in history but it makes the cardinal mistake of too much information crammed into too little time The movie would have definatly benefited from being split into two films and allowed for the story to better pace itself As it stands it is almost a crash course in the fall of Imperial China and the rise of the Republic of China later to be replaced by one failed Imperialist movement and then transformed to communism The movie itself follows the uprisings trying to overthrow the Qhin Dynasty and the political struggles of the falling government as well as the rising one The action is frantic and adds to the chaos of battle yet you can still manage to tell what is going on though unfortunately allot of subtitles tend to fly by talking about battles and events we never get to see Again as said earlier a two parter would have been much better to tell this epic story Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Gene 4 The first half of the movie with violence uprisings and battles is a blast Unfortunately when things settle down into politics it takes a nosedive There is no character development whatsoever one minute they show a character that seems interested and conflicted then they do a cut of two days later where s completely convinced of the right thing to do That s about the whole second part of the movie People arguing deciding stuff with the interesting character development only happening offscreen I would have given the movie a better score if they shaved off the really painful final 30 minutes off of it Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful nate8 2 overly focused on listing historical names

to a feverish night of sex that both find hard to forget Although she s married and he has a girlfriend their intense attraction turns a seemingly casasual one night stand into a continual series of passionate hotel trysts uniting them in a profound and unconventional relationship Unfolding as a collage of moments some sexy some innocent some profound some silly 28 Hotel Rooms is an intimate

Schwartz upends every toy in under two hours and brings in strippers He can get away with this privileged romp because he grooves on what he does in a way that none of his contemporaries can

sequel from a unorganized franchise Yes i m talking about Austin Powers 2 of 4 users found this helpful ballpark frank 4 Right from the beginning this movie will grab fans of the first two Austin Powers movies However there s a small matter of what follows after the cold opening And that s where this flick seems to fall apart Continuing the trend of sexual innuendo funny during the first two merely filler in this one and gross out scenes funny during the second movie but again simply filler in this this wanders aimlessly trying to make fun of Goldfinger which I ll admit would be difficult to do even with a decent plan I think therein lies the problem Goldfinger itself was so over the top it s hard for someone to satirize it to any satisfactory level I liked the first two movies but this entry just left me wondering it Myers and company have finally jumped the sharks yes with laser beams on their heads Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Katherine 0 I liked the first one Loved

horribly wrong Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful SchroederRock 8 Black Hawk Down is a great action packed war movie But if you look through the absolute insanity that is a country at war with itself you ll be given a glimpse at what it means for America to be the world superpower and what others see when good will is met with ruthless opposition Like Vietnam this wasn t the United States fight But when innocent lives are gratuitously slain in the show of power earning the fear and submission of those underneath you movies like Black Hawk Down can easily offer arguments to where politics are a hindrance when there s men and women across the world that are ready to come to the aid of those who cannot help themselves If you love cool action you re going to love Black Hawk Down If you love conscience found in the most desperate circumstances there s something here for you too Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful csw12 8 Black Hawk Down is a very well made movie with some of the best editing and action scenes in years Scott brings you into the film like you were actually there experiencing the terror all around you Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful MartinsH 3 The movie was announced as an anti war movie but its only a detailed story of a mission that fails in which american soldiers are finally depicted as heroes once more Supported by the US Army No real critcism no background information about the war that would allow a deeper questioning of the mission thats not enough This movie is not more than a show The show as such is realistically done but it

the movie was really funny because of Diego Luna and sexy because of Genesis Rodriguez The plot was not the best it could have been but hey it s a comedy Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Human 7 This film has a lot of Tim and Eric style humor as does a lot of Will Ferrell projects these days I did laugh a good deal while watching this film however the pacing was kind of off Like a super ridiculous scene followed by a heartfelt one It just felt kind of inconsistent I think that s part of the problem of relying too much on surrealist humor it can get old fast and too much of it makes the story incoherent so it was applied in small doses All that aside Will Ferrell does an excellent in an all Spanish speaking role Fans of Will Ferrell s more recent works will probably enjoy this Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful TVJerry 5 Will Farrell heads the mostly Hispanic cast as the black sheep son of a Mexican rancher who gets involved with drug dealers and romance This mild comedy spoofs cheesy 70s films and telenovelas some of which is genuinely amusing On the other hand it helps to have an appreciation of the genres being parodied to appreciate all of the gags Farrell plays sweet and dumb really well but the jokes are often quietly witty instead of laugh out loud funny It s a cute curiosity that s entirely in Spanish with subtitles NOTE Stay thru the credits for an absurd cameo Expand 3 of 3 users found this helpful Mantis 5 When I saw the trailer for the first time I was thrilled and wanted to see it After the first 15 20 minutes I already was quite disappointed I think it had potential to be much more They dumbed it down way too much for my taste but I guess you could give it a go if you really have nothing better to watch Most unfortunate Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful MegWhiteley 0 Again We need watching a film of the patetic Will Ferrell I hate all his films and Casa de mi Padre is the worst what is te reason the comedy is

narrative and time shifts but this film is a gem Expand 7 of 14 users found this helpful GabeL 10 It really is a shame on how much of an influence some critics have on how much attention a film gets and how convincing the critic is Precisely why J Edgar is among the most under appreciated films ever made It is a true gem Critics complain that it is too long too boring NOPE J Edgar Hoover was not the most entertaining guy nor the trigger happy blockbuster film hero The film gives an accurate depiction of his life in politics as well as his personal life And people politics can be a boring topic You ll survive Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful StevenF 8 Perhaps quite an anticipated biographical film J Edgar tells the story of at the time the second most powerful man in America FBI director J Edgar Hoover Leonardo DiCaprio gives a masterful performance as the ruthless lawman who s unquestioned part in the growth of crime fighting helped to solidify his status as the birth of modern policing technology J Edgar is told in non linear fashion it jumps throughout the film focusing on Hoovers later years as he is telling the story and going right back to 1919 during his rise in the Bureau This is very much a tale of how Hoover appeared to influence and maintain his public image as the face of the Bureau of Investigation his awkward and consistently questioned homosexual relationship with his longtime assistant Clyde Tolson played confidently by Armie Hammer We see Hoover s attempts to increase the funds for the FBI in an attempt to detain criminals through concrete evidence the introduction of fingerprint databases and forensic laboratories DiCaprio along with director Clint Eastwood have created Hoover in a brilliantly diverse image of intimidation isolation but most of all an undying will to get what he wants DiCaprio s delivery of Hoovers confident speaking and his tactics to appear better than the rest are truly some of the best parts of the film and defining moments in DiCaprio s career The inclusion of various notable political figures throughout Hoover s expansive career make appearances including Richard Nixon and Bobby Kennedy attempt to show the influence that Hoover had over these powerful people and undoubtedly the numerous investigations after his death which looked into his methods including wire tapping and possession of confidential files of leading people There are small things which perhaps bring the film down the lighting is particularly concerning perhaps they were trying to put a different feel on a film set during the Depression but at times its quite difficult see expressions due to the very dim colours the make up used for the later stages of the characters lives is also questionable DiCaprio s is just ok but Armie Hammer s face looks more a severe case of a burn victim rather than an ageing man and the film does perhaps jump to much for many to follow and hold onto its narrative But overall a truly compelling and engaging biographical drama with a spellbindingly powerhouse performance from Leonardo DiCaprio and excellent supporting roles from Naomi Watts Judi Dench and the excellent Armie Hammer J Edgar might just be excellent craftsmanship of how one man can rise the ranks and Eastwood has created a man not many fully understand but who unquestionably remains historic in more ways than one Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Tokyochuchu 6 As one of the greatest cloak and dagger artists in history there is a lot of scope for drama in the tale of J Edgar Hoover s life Unfortunately most of the more remarkable aspects of it are only dealt with as footnotes The movie spreads itself far too thin giving you tiny snippets about this and that but nothing in any detail or depth As such J Edgar is a disappointment Sadly the movie is at it s best when dealing with it s repressed homosexual love story even when the two male leads have almost no chemistry With fine acting and period detailing J Edgar is entertaining enough but ultimately forgettable Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful kingasa2020 5 The movie tends to lose interest halfway through And even though it is so well acted especially Dicaprio Clint Eastwood needs to start shaping up his movies Expand 2 of 4 users found this helpful MajorBob 5 Disappointing That s the only one word review I can give Leo s most recent effort to win an Oscar His portrayal of the man who made the F B I what we know it to be today is a sensational character study Unfortunately the script falls flat in telling the story of how the F B I was transformed under Hoover from a bureaucratic blip into the most potent police force in the world Hoover s latent homosexuality and alleged cross dressing fetish is overplayed as is his devotion to his mother played by the always terrific Judi Dench Perhaps this story was too complicated to fit into one movie and Clint Eastwood s attempt to do justice to the protagonist and to history thus falls far short of the mark The movie completely skips World War II and barely touches on the Cold War and the McCarthy era I found this movie to contain too many snippets of history and too much focus on Hoover s sexuality It is worth seeing for Leo s performance and the production values which as expected from a Clint Eastwood movie which are excellent Expand 0 of 0 users found this

grandiose scope of an action movie with the cramped bare bones stage of a live late night comedy show It s funny because it looks dinky cheap and fake By showing real buildings really exploding and real throats or a believable simulacrum thereof ripped open by real bare hands MacGruber commits the deeply MacGruber esque mistake of shooting itself in the foot All this publication s reviews Read

users found this helpful Necromus 8 I didn t have high expectations when going into this movie I remember enjoying the Macgyver TV show as a kid I also enjoyed the MacGruber skits on SNL This was a really silly movie as is to be expected The movie had some good laughs in it that s all I really expect from a silly parody film Was it one of the best comedies I ve ever seen no Was it decently funny and entertaining yes Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful GeneR 6 This is not a movie that paces itself particularly well 60 minutes of it s play time are kind of a mediocre bore the other 39 are pure gross out brilliance however Seeing it won t be a total waste if you enjoy gross out humor but the long stretches in between the funny skits don t make for much of a movie Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful ArkonBlade 4 how do you take a mildley funny 3 min sketch from SNL and make it into a 90 min movie for the big screen the answer is you dont atleast not a very funny one macgruber in its sketch form is kinda funny with the way they poke fun of mcguyver and him getting blown up at the end of every sketch and the funny song but as a movie it shoulda never been done the humor in this movie is so childish its rediculas if you are in the age of 10 16 you might find this funny i found most of it unfunny there was a couple of funny moments where i had a good laugh but most of it was just to stupid and just had me shaking my head in disbelief that some thing could be this stupid Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful Eddie 0 I have seen literally 100 s of movies and this was by far the worst movie that I have ever seen Was this movie written and directed by a bunch of junior high kids or what The movie tries to be funny but the only joke is on the people who bought

users found this helpful blakewilson 7 An overall refreshing family comedy Parental Guidance is a moral filled and hilarious tale for all ages Billy Crystal and Bette Midler do a wonderful job as grandparents and the children have memorable personalities There s also many laugh out loud moments and some nice insight on the importance of intergenerational wisdom and remaining close to your family no matter what the circumstances Discerning parents do need to know however that despite being free of any language problems or bartending scenes Crystal and Midler still provide some mostly mild adult humor Also there s also a few toilet humor jokes and a few moments of mischief obnoxiousness Still though its a movie parents with kids ages 7 and up will enjoy For a more detailed review visit www moviestakenseriously blogspot com Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Mr Muumi 4 Parental Guidance starts with promising first 10 minutes but finishes as dime a dozen family comedy Good clean fun and pulling some heartstrings along the way guaranteed Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful TheQuietGamer 4 It s hard for me to hate on a family friendly movie with a sweet side like this one especially when movies are getting super vulgar now days But Parental Guidance fails to bring laughs and fails to hook you with it s emotional side This makes the movie super boring Add in the fact that this is aimed at families with kids of all ages and its failure makes it all the more sad As much as it pains me to say Parental Guidance is not worth your time You can safely pass on this one Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful mmweiss 2 Not only completely unfunny Parental Guidance is repetitive uninteresting and annoying This new Billy Crystal family comedy is wrong in every sense It s frenetic yet it has no rhythm There are absolutely no gags in this screenplay with absolutely no structure It s filled with cliches 5 minutes in you can guess what s going to happen in the last scene Basically this film is garbage Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Thegodfatherson 0 Billy crystal in a crappy kids film Seriously This was a really bad film Very bad It was not even a great kids film It s was garbage The end is predictable the kids don t make everything funny and billy crystal sucks at being a grandpa 0 10 for me I suggest you stay away from this film Expand 0 of 0 users

relive those good memories Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful Edgeyx 10 I m a massive fan of all things Pok mon so I found it really hard to dislike but if i had to I would say that I didn t like the friendship moral s but I guess that just comes with it being a film targeted at kids Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful Elizebeth 10 Mewtwo is a really cool character idea It s a cool story line and I really like it The only thing that I m commenting on the bad side is that Pikachu s vacation is cheesy Expand 5 of 5 users found this helpful Glitter 6 Despite the childish source the material is rather bleak and centric on the meaning of one s life with the questioning of being Perhaps best viewed as expanded episode of the earlier Pokemon anime Mewtwo Strikes Back works as an abecedarian to Pokemon and an amateur pedagony in philosophy Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful eTurkey 5 Chances are you re most probably a fan of the television show if you see this movie Or at least you should be because only a real Pok Maniac would like everything about this feature even the not so good aspects Noticeable differences from the anime include better animation larger budget no doubt which is this film s strong suit but sadly it more or less ends there The story is rather bland and stereotypical especially the abrupt ending The music seemed strange and although easy on the ears it didn t match the mood of the flick Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful SEROJ 4 This review contains spoilers click expand to view With terrible story and ending Pokemon The First Movie is probably the worst Pokemon experience you can get Why MewTwo gave up on the end Just because Ash got in the middle of the clash I thought he hated humans because they re traitors And why did he killed the people who created him This movie has SO MUCH issues i would give it a 2 10 or 3 10 but it s one of my childhood movies and i love the nostalgia feeling so my final score is 4 10 Not recommended especially if you re not a pokemon fan Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful aaronpaul121 1 Absolutely terrible though it is a little bit better than its next films 0 of 1 users found this helpful

action and romance I thought the story line was very good and kept me guessing the whole time I do not understand why the ratings are so bad if your not just looking for love but for some action with it I would definitely suggest this movie Expand 2 of 2 users found this helpful Proteus 6 The definition of haven is a place of safety so we have here a safe place of safety This means that the girl

s kind this year I m not a Jolie fan like anything with DiCaprio and a couple of others their name makes me think twice before going to see any movie they re in But she did a great job here with a story that could have been far worse than any 24 script The sleeper premise is far fetched but if you can get past that it s a very entertaining film with more going for it than stunts and action But since it s a summer movie there is plenty of both I guess we need a break from reality and a trip back to the bad old Cold War days was almost a relief I saw lots of happy faces leaving the theater after this one Expand 2 of 4 users found this helpful alanh 10 If you don t like this film I guess you don t like spy stories or action movies This is a great one As for all the supposed holes in the

right This is a a don t miss thriller Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful axelkoch 8 This movie has so unbelievably many turns of events and thats what makes it so great It s illogical and makes

7 Let me just start off by saying that the trailers for Salt do it absolutely no justice and make it look like the most generic of forgotten identity action movies Salt is much more than that Due to seeing that trailer around 50 times my expectations were deflated but truthfully those expectations were never very high I sat and watched as every minute my negative thoughts for this movie before I saw it were washed away and I became immersed in the action If you are like me and were close to writing it off as garbage think again Salt stars Angelina Jolie as Evelyn Salt a Expand 0 of 0 users

brilliant Easily one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time Also the ending is excellent and so perfect it s not even funny Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful AlaricD 10 Kurosawa s Seven Samurai is a symphony of cinematic splendor vibrancy and vision A talisman of epic action character and story telling perfectly harmonized Pure genius captured and codified on celluloid Expand 7 of 8 users

entertainment that never even for a second feels like you re reading words in a book as you look at the subtitles Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful distractonator 10 This is by far the greatest movie that I had the pleasure to view my only regret is not knowing Japanese I can not describe how good this movie is just know that it is at least 3 times as good as there will be blood and 4 times as good as once upon a time in the west Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful cameronmorewood 10 Kurosawa s Seven Samurai is the very apex of cinema It tells a complete and full story rich with striking action and compassionate humanity It literally is the three and a half hour epic so many filmmakers have tried and failed to produce Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful ReviewerBanana 0 Its pretty hilarious that people unanimously pretend to like this movie It may have been amazing almost 60 years ago but today its kind of like watching a play its not much fun and you realize how bad entertainment must have been back then for people to have enjoyed it This movie made sense in 1954 japan like Islam made sense in 6th century arabia understandable people were into it at the time but today its just a work of fiction composed by a borderline retarded person This movie makes Bio Dome look like a magnum opus of cinema in fact Pauley Shore would have really improved the Seven Samurai add in a Baldwin and it might be watchable by a non pretentious non film student viewer Expand 1 of 25 users found this helpful See all 35 User Reviews var nr domain www metacritic com var nrelate

HenryP1983 10 NEMESIS is a pure delight for fans and non fans This film is filled with great acting performances by Patrick Stewart as Captain Jean Luc Picard and Tom Hardy as the evil villain Praetor Shinzon We for the first time in the Star Trek universe get to explore the Romulan Senate political structure the twin world Remus and see for the first time the Remans While there are great action sequences the main heart of NEMESIS is Shinzons struggle for his identity over Picard This is a must see for fans of philosophical dramas as well as those who love science fiction A must see Expand 1

the last 10 minutes that you just didn t know which one it was going to be The only thing predictable about this movie is that Although the movie does not throw in any events from the tv series the story moves well from event to event I was amazed at the resemblance of the android b 4 and data I was waiting for someone to say he lookd just like data s brother from the tv series who s name i have forgotten This is the movie making makeup that goes along with most movies Not everyone has seen the episoeds and this is generally the best way to keep things rolling with a new audience Being a fan of star trek and not the other star star something moive I liked this film I did the best i could to not throw in any spoilers so get to the movies and see how the end of a generation starts your weekend Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful JoeyK 10 Great movie Visually awesome Philosophically intriguing Emotionally dramatic I loved it as a Trek film and as even a regular movie and I really don t understand why people didn t like it I d give it a 9 but I m giving it a 10 because it deserves better than it got Expand 0 of 2 users found this helpful Necromus 7 This review contains spoilers click expand to view I was a fan of the Star Trek TNG TV series in fact to this day it is my favourite TV series of all time But like Generations and Insurrection this one just ended up being mediocre With the exception of Star Trek First Contact with was absolutely great there were TV episodes equal and in some cases better than the TNG movies I m still bitter about them cancelling the series while it was the number one rated TV show just so they could make 3 mediocre movies and 1 good movie SPOILER ALERT I can t believe they killed off data I mean I knew one main character was going to die ahead of time but Data BTW I was hoping they d make 1 more TNG movie just so they could bring him back it was pretty obvious how they laid the ground work to do so Data s memory chip was in his android er artificial lifeform brother s head although his brother couldn t access the memories there was the potential for him to expand his hardware programming later to bring Data s memories back and incorporate them but I guess Data is gone forever since they will never make that movie now Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Sam 7 A movie shouldn t be loved if your a fanboy of the movie series it should be loved for the quality Not ot say I hated this movie the plot is a good Idea but the action scenes are getting to tiresome and the special effects are great but all of the other star trek movies except for the first are better and i m not saying that as a fanboy but as a movie buff Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful Rox22 6 Here you can see that the TNG crew is getting a little tired and stale It was better than Insurrection but not by much I did find the premise interesting but it s execution felt a little underwhelming and flat Overall It is a decent movie that could have been better If I had to some it up in one word Underwhelming Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful FantasyL 1 Nemesis was so bad and juvenile that I cringed during the showing The dialogue and acting was a complete joke Patrick Stewart must be puking after wathcing his own performance in this DREK Gene has to be turning over in his grave with Capt Kirk probably grateful that he is

Chopper carrying the bus in the air and THe car chase with the TVR There s also the club esque attitude of the atmosphere and a sleek stylish feel with a house soundtrack to match Unfortunately horrendously incoherent writing and atrocious dialogue ultimately derail Swordfish from being good rendering it an incoherent mess with worthy moments and a touch of style Overall maybe worth a watch if you can enjoy the grimness and the junkish attitude Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful FrankO 5 A convoluted plot that I did not understand waste of good talent on this flick a nice rental but I would not pay full price to see it 0 of 1 users found this helpful Seriosity 5 A half interesting half ridiculous often pointless occasionally entertaining exercise of big budgetary nonsense It tries to hide its nonsensical and implausible plot with techno babble and constant action but ultimately ends up a mindless action thriller with a lot of typing in front of a monitor screen filled

all of them and the best is this 1 because it start of the story of the film Expand 0 of 2 users found this helpful Bruce722 9 There aren t many movies over the last dozen years to have a bigger impact on society than this one The Fast and the Furious glorified street racing and made the Honda Civic and the other cars featured in the film must buys for teenage boys across America The reason is pretty obvious the movie is outstanding The cast of Paul Walker Vin Diesel Jordana Brewster and others is outstanding and the story is really interesting and unique The plot and characters are all really well developed creating an immersive viewing experience not often seen in movies under two hours The cars and race scenes are fantastic and the action has you sitting on the edge of your seat The only negative for me was some of the cinematic effects The director tried to get cute and a lot of those effects actually hurt the scenes not helped Nonetheless those few sequences aren t enough to ruin the film and the entertainment value for the movie is still sky high Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful grandpajoe6191 7 The Fast and the Furious is not exactly a good movie maybe because of Vin Diesel muscle cars and sexy babes in it but it s not a bad one either 4 of 7 users found this helpful Movie1997 7 The movie may not be a genuin masterpiece but its still a fun thrill ride Even though it has a great storyline with great actors but sometimes it struggles With the actors they ll sometimes loose your attention but they still keep interested in the story With the storyline its great when it stays on topic but when you put in the side show such as looking at all the hot girls booties it gets really distracting But hopefully for all the perverts it s something good to look at A big plus is that it has some really cool action Which helps it get the title Fast and Furious Overall it has its moments but still turns out to be a fun action joy ride Expand 0 of 0 users found

indeed art 9 of 12 users found this helpful LordOFlibertY 10 You could easily tell the people that rate the film a 0 10 are either trolling or die hard fans of rival series such as Harry Potter and I pity those shameful morons because this film is excellent and a marvel at its time When I first watched this film as a kid I have never seen anything like it on movie ever before It was intense it was interesting the soundtrack is excellent and most importantly the ensemble cast was an absolutly perfect My favourite scene was the council at Rivendell It is very interesting how each character has their different opinion on the Ring and the best battle sequence was during Moria of course the Cave Troll made it great I personally praise the acting of Sean Boromir Bean Sean Samwise Astin and Ian Gandalf Mckellen I thought those 3 stood out because of how dramatic they can act without making a fool of themselves When the film hit on Dvds and Videos I immediatly bought it along with the other 2 movies in support of the how inspiring and influentional those films were to me Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful StevenF 10 It s strange and quite gut wrenching to think that as I review this the first part of arguably one of the best trilogies to grace cinema was released 12 years ago but it s fascinating at how much there has been since then yet this trilogy has withstood the test of countless blockbusters and attempts at recreating it fantastical adventures Peter Jackson brings to life the vision that author J R R Tolkien envisioned in his fantastic books full of heart colourful characters and magical elements that set it heads above the competition truly an adventure like no other While much of the film shows the advancements of computer generated magnificence it possesses a very human touch from its ensemble cast and riveting stories that each of them tell the biggest of course being that of Frodo Baggins Elijah Wood a hobbit who lead a simple way of life in the Shire a quiet and peaceful place for those quite content with the easier but finer things in life but as our story goes Frodos uncle Bilbo holds a secret that changes the tone for the foreseeable future as an evil is coming and Frodo holds the power to stop it various events lead to Frodo and his other Hobbit friends Sam Pippin and Merry Sam Astin Billy Boyd Dominic Monaghan setting out to destroy the ring in the place it was forged the fiery Mount Doom But as mentioned there is more than this story being told we meet shadowy ranger Aragorn Viggo Mortensen who is certainly more than meets the eye while we also have a hawk eyed elf called Legolas Orlando Bloom the outspoken but proud Boromir Sean Bean and a hot tempered dwarf called Gimli John Rys Davies The ring itself is a tempting power a power that can entice and corrupt at any given moment Ian McKellan plays an ageing wizard called Gandalf the Grey who knows exactly what this ring is capable of but is willing to guide this Fellowship until the end This first entry combines everything into a near flawless film fantasy story driven violent epic emotional and touching where it matters most we don t have a perfect fellowship of individuals here we have foes untrustworthy acquaintances accidental travellers and some not really wanting to be there but they are all driven my one goal one that will see them travel across Middle Earth to complete Peter Jackson perfectly captures a world unlike any other occupying it with magical mischief and all sorts of good and evil which the film perfectly represents it mixes light and dark and often cuts deeply into the flaws of both while also showing first hand the power of the two on a massive scale there s nothing quite like it The mesmerising cinematography outlines the scope of the film from lush green landscapes to the snow covered mountaintops and deep into the underground each place vastly different than the last full of beauty terror frightening beings with groundbreaking effects costumes and real landscapes that bring it to life but this isn t possible without the phenomenal cast in tow Ian McKellan and Viggo Mortensen are standouts of the film engrossed in their characters where we can truly feel safe with them as we trek through Middle Earth but the then relatively unknown Elijah Wood does an excellent job as the likeable Frodo keeping a level head but

users found this helpful ApocalypseBrown 9 What makes me sick is when critics love shite films and pan excellent ones Fortunately this follows in that tradition This film will give you what you want to take from it from violence intrigue warmth and humor it packs it all And considering the emotional ride it takes the viewer on it is easy to over looked its small yet silly faults Ok Caan and the lover of Juliette Lewis Dr dude performances weren t memorable but the rest of the cast coupled with the slow yet tense car chase scene and the dramatic shoot outs leave you almost breathless I am not a critic who is paid to give bad scores so nine reflects the quality of this venture What you gonna tell God now Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful ChrisG 8 Finally a caper flick starring criminals who aren t either too funny too scary or too emotional to believe Love the slow quiet alley car chase and unspoken communication between the two Subtle No wonder the critics panned it Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful robbotis 8 This is very good film The cast is awesome The first scene hilarious and plenty of other good ones The middle does drag a bit so that keeps it down a notch But Del Toro Phillipe and such are all so good Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful PhilN 8 I love this film it has its flaws but I honestly can t see why it is so underrated The principle characters are despicable and there s no justification for their actions that s partly the point of the film and is to me an honest and realistic way to depict violence far preferable to action movies in which we re asked to forget forgive or applaud the various deaths the protagonists cause yet it seems to be a common criticism of this film I just don t understand that way of thinking It seems to me the intentional coldness and amorality seen in this movie is way out of fashion now had it appeared in the 70s would it have been a classic like Point Blank The film has some truly excellent dialogue and non verbal communication but it has to be said that McQuarrie got a bit carried away at times and some of the lines are just too oblique to be understood or too clever to be believable And while their motivation is clear Parker Longbaugh s tactics in the final action scene are questionable their approach somewhat less intelligent than we should expect from them But in my opinion these are negligible flaws next to the film s strengths not least some of the finest firefights ever filmed All performances from biggest to smallest are absolutely spot on and the score is wonderful I would say if you re a fan of 70s films like The Getaway or Bullit that are appreciated for their bleak and unpleasant qualities then you ll probably get a kick out of Way Of The Gun I wish there were more crime action movies like it Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful TheWalrus2000 7 It does seem a bit sloppy at times The Way of the Gun is an entertaining thrill ride not to mention a

alarming rates Despite increased spending and politicians promises our buckling public education system once the best in the world routinely forsakes the education of millions of children On Oscar winning filmmaker Davis Guggenheim reminds us that education statistics have names Anthony Francisco Bianca Daisy and Emily whose stories make up the engrossing foundation of Waiting for Superman As he follows a handful of promising kids through a system that inhibits rather than encourages academic growth Guggenheim undertakes an exhaustive review of public education surveying drop out factories and academic sinkholes methodically dissecting the system and its seemingly intractable problems However embracing the belief that good teachers make good schools Guggenheim offers hope by exploring innovative approaches taken by education reformers and charter schools that have in reshaping the culture refused to leave their students behind Paramount Vantage Point Expand Director Davis

the US but I think many of the problems can be related to any other country like Canada It is unexpectedly touching The graphs the story telling all is well done A time you wont regret Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful OscarPicks2010 8 There was another movie about a similar subject called The Lottery The movie was solely about the charter schools lotteries it wasn t committed on the broken school system Waiting For Superman is completely different It took on an in depth look at our public school systems and how damaged it is over the years It isn t a subject that everyone cares about but it is definitely an important documentary that Davis Duggenheim An Inconvenient Truth wanted people to see Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful smijatov 6 Waiting for Superman may thematically be one of the most important documentaries in recent U S history The educational system is in dire need of help and this film provides clear alternatives and points out who is to blame for the lack of willingness to cooperate and rejuvenate the system Technically the film is not that great It is very long and it lacks cohesion It is all over the place and while it focuses on a number of families it is still too large in scope The D C focus is nice but is not substantiate by any reasoning behind it Was it because it was a success story Or was it because it was D C Or some other reason Nonetheless it has some good moments and the ending sequences of the acceptance lottery are heartbreaking to say the least Thematically excellent technically not quite there Good film overall 6 10 Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful Tss5078 5 Waiting For Superman is an inside look at the problems with education in America The film is extremely eye opening showing just how bad a state most of our education systems are in They clearly illustrate that no matter the area teachers are failing America s youth at an alarming rate I found the film to be very biased though as it only points out what s wrong with the system and fails to mention any of the positives that still exist in education It also fails to offer solutions for the problems Guggenheim throws lots of facts and figures at us and repeats the same themes It gets to a point where he s just beating us over the head with the same concepts Many people saw this as an inspirational call to action but me I saw it as a guy complaining Honestly if you can t offer up a solution than why present the problem I m pretty sure that almost everyone in America knows how bad education has gotten even if they don t have the exact figures in front of them Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful CClark 0 A myopic one sided rant long on bluster and woefully short on substance While the film claims to analyze a serious issue it s really a simple

legacy What is that legacy An evolution of increasingly intricate textured songs with impossibly gorgeous hooks That s what you get with this EP Even the relatively weak What Goes Boom stands up to heavy repeat listening Indie Cindy will be the standout on this set deservedly so it s instantly addicting demanding repeat listenings from the get go but Another Toe may be the most lovely bubble gum song and you haters remember Here Comes Your Man and Digging for Fire Bubble gum ever made deceptively simple on the first listen and it just grows like a rose on repeat listens Thank you Pixies Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Forest90 8 Eh I don t get it Why all the negativity I thought there were 4 great songs here very Trompe le Monde with modern production I just don t Is it bitterness at Kim Deal leaving Is it the fear that they will ruin their legacy I don t know I don t understand why it s being slated What is this nonsense about their legacy anyway Nobody was worried when MBV came out everyone was euphoric and slightly demented with excitement no talk about ruining the legacy of Loveless then so why now A band reforms makes some music it sounds good It doesn t risk ruinin gtheir legacy in any way those albums are not going anywhere Wake up in 2013 people Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful cjcarr21 7 While I agree it is not the best stuff they have done Indie City and Andro Queen are pretty top notch tunes What Goes Boom and Another Toe in the Ocean are the weaker songs but still a good honest effort Franks lyrics still make you think and Joey Santiago still rules on guitar 7 5 10 Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful MTSmithTWH 7 Most of the reviews of this record are garbage If you re expecting The Pixies to sound like they did on their first 2 records forget it Change your expectations If you ve been following Frank Black over the years this EP makes complete sense and is truly enjoyable This one is more for fans of songs in the vein of Abstract Plain than for those expecting more Crackity Jones This EP is a nice treat and bodes well for the future of the band s now more mature song writing styles which may not be everyone s thing Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful cocadaking 3 I have been listening to the Pixies for more than a decade and I must say the Pixies never sounded this weak and uninspired It is not just Kim Deal absence that is felt here the trippy lyrics the guitar sound that amazing guitar sound remember everything else is just unappealing In fact these songs are closer to Frank Black solo material than Pixies related The thing is calling his fellow musicians to play a Frank Black album doesn t make it a Pixies one at all It s ok if a band changes their sound trying to pursue something new but in this album my rock and roll heroes failed miserably and I can accept that Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful var nr domain www metacritic com var nrelate dwparams mapp nrelate comptype widget

amazing you have the nice slow love songs i e party hard stuck on stupid 4years old and then the club tracks turn up the music dont wake me up and trumpet lights and the sexual strip 2012 sweet love biggest fan and till i die and bassline the wraps and mirage just a nice mix so something there for everyone so to be honest all these bad reviews haved nothing to do with the album i can tell its more about your opinion of him and you can get back by slamming the album absolutly pathetic people grow up Expand 1 of 2 users found this helpful Miszi 10 After hearing the 5 singles realeased from Fortune I was thinking it s gonna be good but nowhere near good as the last album F A M E needless to say I was wrong The album s singles give a little wrong idea of what the album serves Why Because I expected mostly dance pop driven record and instead I get something that comes closer to Chris Brown s first 2 albums The album seems much more cohesive than the last 2 records even though I never had a problem with that It starts of with Turn up the music continues with Dubstep influenced Bassline and then switches to the futuristic sounding Till I Die but later on it s R B and only R B until the last 2 tracks at the end unless you count Nas feature on Mirage which is probably my favourite record on the album It doesn t get boring though the production on it s own keeps you entertained There is a great ton of detail on each of the songs making them intresting and often creating a great build up The lyrics seem to be better than on the last album aswell most notably on Don t Judge Me 4 Years Old and Stuck on Stupid When it comes to vocals the greatest showcase of Brown s abbility comes on Cadillac interlude which is a nearly acappella song It leaves you wishing it wasn t just an interlude All in all Fortune is a great album that is sure to become underrated mostly because of artist s personal life but hey everyone got their own ears listen yourself and see if you like it I highly recommend deluxe version you wouldn t like to miss out on Free Run or Wait For You Expand 3 of 6 users found this helpful BeeMichael 10 Chris Brown s Fortune album is destined to be deemed as a Pop confection and a cacophony of sexual lyrics and sounds But this is entirely incorrect It is again an underrated album Chris Brown s newest studio album shows his journey as an artist both musically and creatively in the entire saga of Fortune in art as a music video director and entertainer With songs like 2012 Biggest Fan and Sweet Love he sets the tone for the night in romantic sweet and sometimes super sexual evenings with his Boo Don t Judge Me and 4 Years Old look back onto the past and reveal his real emotions about past relationships and possible concerns about the speed at which his career has taken off reminiscing friend Tyga s Moving 2 Fast Party Hard Bassline and Biggest Fan are the most single ready of the yet to be released tracks on the album Party Hard is a song about that girl who you are interested in but can never get the moment to show how you feel about her it s total infatuation After Party Hard there is a short interlude which features Chris favorite female artist Se7en called Cadillac where Chris and Se7en sing acapella Bassline is an exemplary example of a real music artist using dubstep the correct way in which many Pop artists have simply jumped onto a dubstep track to try and be on the current trend Kudos to Breezy for creating a song representative of the actual genre and being creative as well Mirage and Til I Die are two songs for the Hip Hop crowd with Mirage featuring Hip Hop legend Nas and the latter featuring hot rappers Big Sean and Wiz Khalifa Of course Strip one of Brown s most successful R B jams to date is on the middle of the album featuring label mate CBE and mentee Kevin McCall Turn Up The Music one of his biggest Pop Dance songs to date Don t Wake Me Up and Trumpet Lights are the Eurodance tracks Chris has become known for the past few years They feature futuristic sounds big bass and winding lyrics to get fans and non fans on the dance floor Trumpet Lights is the most adventurous and unique track on the album with the sounds of Eurodance Salsa and Dubstep rolled into one of Fortune s best tracks It also features new CBE Signee Sabrina Antoinette Fortune shows a lot of growth creatively both in and out of the studio It is a surefire hit for TeamBreezy and should win over new fans and people interested in R B Pop or Dubstep Chris has a lot of jams no matter which genre you re interested in and they are all very well produced written and performed on Fortune This album shows how he has grown since F A M E was released in March 2011 I recommend you purchase this album and even splurge on the deluxe edition where there is sure to be more A grade R B Pop and Dubstep to fill your home car or iPod with this summer Expand 6 of 10 users found this helpful raphred 4 Fortune tries to go back to the future for no reason It tries to be like those 90s album that strive to have a 21st century sound It pretty much tries too hard but at the same time keeps what R B artists try to get away from Making the same song on every album This album wasn t from the heart but from the radio Expand 2 of 3 users found this helpful maria 01 2 Generic forgettable excessive auto tune Chris Brown needs to step it up This is really mediocre his live voice doesn t help the contrast with the 90 from his performances which are lip synched is cringe worthy Expand 2 of 5 users found this helpful kbyrd2 2 As someone who has purchased all of Chris Brown s previous albums I was highly disappointed This sounds like an album of leftover mix tapes tracks Absolute garbage embarrassing to his catalogue of music Give us time to miss you Chris because this was rushed pop garbage Expand 1 of 4 users found this helpful lpfan2000 0 Terrible autotuned electronical pop music with a dose of oversized ego no wonder

brutal attack that almost cost him his life In recent years however 50 Cent was lucky enough to hook up with Eminem who signed him and producer Dr Dre which resulted in a track on the 8 Mile soundtrack and now this his much anticipated first full length release Expand Record Label Interscope Aftermath Genre s Rap More Details and Credits Critic Reviews Score distribution Positive 15 out

10 I think this album is great I mean every song is amazing its a different direction and I m in love with it Each song on the album is versatile and you ll never get bored Expand 3 of 4 users found this helpful le one 8 This is by far the best album by the band I said it they said and other people said it It s undeniable It s strong It s epic It s deep You can realize this is lyrically personal The best tracks here are Do or Die Bright Lights the lead single Up in the Air and City of Angels Conquistador although a little bit repetitive does its job well so as The Race End of All Days is good but certainly not a highlight Such as Northern Lights a track made to please fans of a heavier 30 Seconds to Mars Some tracks such as Birth give the impression of being fillers Depuis Le D but for instance was supposed to work as an incredible ending Well it s an ending Not incredible though Convergence although a little bit vague works better with the concept of the album than the last track And Pyres of Varanasi that s something to discuss So the bottom line is There are some excellent highlights songs here that are worth checking out But buying this album should be a more delicate decision because there are eight full songs here and four interludes That means that 1 3 of the album could feel be a filler for you if you don t appreciate the kind of art that Jared and his gang are trying to express through this album My suggestion is if you like the first single to check out tracks like Do or Die and City of Angels and see how you feel about them Next step Bright Lights and The Race and so on Expand 3 of 4 users found this helpful ErickFernandes 6 Good They are back with good songs but is not their best album Some songs are incredible but just some Anyway it s real and Jared s voice sounds great Expand 3 of 4 users found this helpful alex2542 4 I ve been a long time fan of this band They aren t everyone s cup of tea and I understand that What others call pretentious and derivative I enjoy But even I can only stomach so much This just isn t a good album Up in the Air Conquistador City of Angels Do or Die and maybe Bright Lights are the only reason to even listen the first two being the only ones I really enjoyed ironically the two that got me excited for the album It s not that they re really bad songs They re just boring and unremarkable in general Big fan of the band Disappointed in this album I ve been waiting so long for Feels more like an EP with a collection of B sides than anything else Expand 3 of 6 users found this helpful JacksColdSweat 1 I was once such a fan of this band I went as far as to get a tattoo After listening to this album how much I regret that choice This boring and lifeless album is a shadow of previous albums So many times I was told to embrace their change but clearly all change is not for the best With repetitive noises played across the whole album with no songs really offering a roar of excitement heard in The Kill or Closer to the Edge With a minimal 12 songs and 3 of those consisting of nothing but a random assortment of noise disappointment is an understatement I am reminded of Linkin Parks Living Things album

whatever mood you are in hard head bangin rappish slow sad and a beat mood this cd won t let you down At least 2 songs are for a diffren mood And the lyrics aren t that bad very catchy I must say the only songs I m not crazy about are Behind blue eyes only cause it s a remake of a classic and Red light green light which the main rap song on the whole cd It is a little monotonous but whatever And the fact they have short good music song sequences after songs for people who hate the cd don t even know these songs exists It s like a treat for putting through the worst songs on the cd coincidentally Behind Blue Eyes and Red light green light But all in all the cd is awesome A cd I have yet to get tored of in 5 1 2 months Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful C Marsalis 10 We came across this album by accident over the last few months Contrary to all the bad publicity about this album it is without doubt one of the most important albums since 1993 The production and ideas within this album are quite unique The last albums to contain such artistry was Songs of Distant Earth by Mike Oldfield and Talk by Yes Its quite disgraceful on some of the voting obviously from people who have no clue about music production We have analysed some reviews by these individuals on other albums and its quite sad and obvious that these critics are like everything within the industry to be aiding and abetting the demise of talent within the music industry We suggest that those critics should become independent from the Record Companies Its ok monopolizing CD Sales etc but to monopolise what talent is is detrimental to the industry Expand 3 of 4 users found this helpful jeffs 9 fuck you all who hate this album if u do not like limp bizkit dont listen to them and dont

found this helpful brownallaround 8 For a band that seemed to be on the verge of collapse after two untimely deaths and some departing members are more focused than ever on Strange Weather Isn t It I like the focus on solid grooves that form the basis of every track on the album The late Jerry Fuchs provides his tight drumming talent on The Hammer and The Most Certain Sure sounds like something you d see Dirk Diggler dancing to at Boogie Nights It goes by rather quickly at about 40 minutes but there isn t one weak song to be found Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful MikeColina 2 A tedious minimal electro pop record delivered by this Sacramento Ca band that helps as a shopping or elevator background music It just causes the boring reaction because of its way using almost the same regular tempo while trying to make a tribute to the disco electro funk records Beware of the singer who tries to be sexy and stylish 7 people on his band and no one stoped him A perfect gift for your

helpful Stanbase 9 Opening with some cheesey lines in Intro first impressions leave you skeptical as to what else is in store on The Female Boss then Tulisa s chart topping Young kicks in One thing that makes this album stand out from the crowd is the variety of different sounds from ballads like Skeletons to urban esque tracks like the infectious British Swag and Visa There are some sure hits on the album if dealt with correctly With an almost perfect blend of slow and fast jams The Female Boss is deserving of more praise than it has had if only it was given the chance to be judged on the merits of the album rather than Tulisa s misjudged character unfairly portrayed by the media Scream and Shout would have earned it a deserving 10 10 if only Britney didn t take that hit from beneath her feet A brilliant album overall let s drink to it Expand 1 of 3 users found this helpful Maltaquas 8 In recent years it has sort of become the norm for X Factor judges to release their own material once on the show Tulisa is no exception However this led to speculation about the quality of her music She has an unremarkable voice but in The Female Boss something actually struck me The listener is introduced into the world of female bosses by means of deep emotional piano notes What s really not deep is the cliche speech Tulisa gives about inna beauty After Young Live It Up and Damn conclude the dance feel of the album is dissipated I m not saying that British Swag is not infectious because it is indeed an album highlight but it was misplaced in the album As the album progresses I became intoxicated with certain songs such as Counterfeit and I m Ready All in all I found the album to be quite an outstanding collection of music HOWEVER if you don t have an eclectic love for pop music DO NOT purchase the album because it doesn t suit you There s a sound for everything on this album which makes it so love able Personally I would have left some songs out Steal My Breath Away Foreigner and Kill Me Tonight were songs which I felt do not go with the rest of the album I think they are the filler tracks on The Female Boss Conclusion Excellent debut with songs which can become hits effortlessly Live Your Life Visa An enjoyable and warm collection which can have huge success depending on its management Expand 2 of 5 users found this helpful StrawberryBlond 1 I m not keen on Tulisa Even before she was a judge on X Factor I didn t rate her highly and considered her judging placement so random But after taking Little Mix to victory last year Tulisa has really established herself and after several years in the barely successful band N Dubz she s decided that it s time to go the solo route And after hearing the first few singles I knew this was going to be a great listen purely for comedy value so I tried it And boy is it a stinker We start off with Tulisa speaking some cliched inspirational feminist speech with a weird pause I might add over a piano composition which automatically sets her up for failure as already she s taking herself far too seriously And what follows are tracks that define scraping the bottom of the barrel There s the We Found Love rip off 1 single Young the cheesy faux urban Live It Up and the bland lifeless Damn But then we get the Holy Grail of bad music the cringey epically bad British Swag if ever there were two words that should never be coupled together where Tulisa brags to a non existent American audience I m all about my dollars but I specialise in pounds She is truly one of the finest un intentional comedians ever Then there s the bizarre ballad Foreigner that s meant to be anti racism but is executed so badly that it comes off like the opposite with analogies that really make you feel uncomfortable Speaking of ballads it may surprise you that not including the interludes half of the album consists of ballads and dear me they re as bland and boring as watching paint dry and her voice is average at best not the type that can be showcased on a ballad Even the Diane Warren written song Counterfeit couldn t be salvaged I m sure that such tracks will not impress Tulisa s fans who were expecting lots of dance music considering that Young was the lead single The only upsides are club banger Live Your Life the spiritual sounding Skeletons and the genuinely sad Habit But even then they re not amazing just not bad By the time Tulisa rounds it all off with her cheesy Outro you just want to laugh at her delusions of fame She needs to drop this Female Boss alias schtick No one not even her fans are buying into it While she co wrote almost the entire album she is not an artist as she always insists on calling herself She is a product nothing more Tulisa is way out of her depth and it looks like the dream s over before it even got started The album debuted on the UK singles chart at an appalling 35 with just over 15 000 copies sold and where it ll chart next week is anyone s guess And it wasn t like she had no promotion she had the best promotion she could get and it still wasn t enough This proves that Tulisa is in no position to be an X Factor judge How can she give contestants advice about how to be successful when she doesn t know how to achieve it herself Even Dappy s solo album managed a surprising 6 on the charts with no X Factor or Britain s Got Talent promotion If rumours of an N Dubz reunion are true it looks like Tulisa needs them more than they need her Here s a comeback to the last words on her outro If it doesn t work out give up Expand 2 of 4

If you ve heard the song I Love It then you may know who Icona Pop is they are a Swedish duo of two girls who sing about partying going wild and being just plain sassy So after hearing I Love it thousands of times each day I grew onto the duo and I was looking forward to This is Icona Pop because I was disappointed by their first EP Iconic EP which aside from the first two songs everything else on that collection was forgettable and boring I m happy to report that This is Iconic Pop is a great debut album for Icona Pop and I kinda loved it But for those who can t stand Mainstream Pop or Dance music you should stay away from this because it is very much like that This album only runs for 34 minutes which is very short but has enough punch to make me forget that I could just listen to this in one sitting The first half was the standout here even though I ve heard many of the singles off of here before it still felt refreshing and most importantly fun The last few songs are also great where instead of going super slow and full of ballads it doesn t overstay it s welcome and it ends with the emo like Then We Kiss which sounds like a perfect party song for a wild party Other favorites include I Love it All Night We Got the World Ready for the Weekend and more Problems with this album are that there is no clear story as it s just to show everyone who Icona Pop really is also this isn t a problem but you might think that this album isn t meant for the male demographic as it is more meant for 13 year old girls who are surprised to hear a curse word in a dance song But overall I really enjoyed This is Icona Pop it s short sweet and packs a huge wallop of beats sounds and noises If your not interested in Icona Pop then this album won t change your mind and it doesn t do anything earth shatteringly amazing But if you let it all loose and forget your problems you ll as a quote from the first song love it Because I did Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful WadeVS 8

this album were EXTREMELY low Almost didn t waste my time downloading it for free and listening to it but i m glad i did Maybe it seemed better to me because of my low or possibly complete lack of expectation for this album but overall i think it was well put together and definitely their best release since Evolver in 03 While it was very short and still not back to their old style i feel as if they did a better job of embracing their evolving style of music than they had with their previous release The members are getting older and have families now their views on life change and as that happen their style of music changes as is seen with many artists This album put together a few quality songs and overall it was satisfactory Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful centurysleuth 7 While not phenomenal and on the short side far superior to 2009 s wretched Uplifter And honestly that might have been enough to put a smile on my face Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful cameronmorewood 4 311 s new album feels dazed and distant It doesn t connect with its listeners Maybe ten albums is enough 0 of 0 users found this helpful Captiosus 4 311 s Presale Site delivered copies early so I have been fortunately perhaps unfortunate to have this album since Friday 7 15 11 As a fan of 311 since 1993 I m very disappointed in the direction the band has been going First of all one should know this is the shortest full release 311 has ever come out with comprised of only 8 songs and clocking in at a total running time of 29 minutes 46 seconds Any other band would have called this an EP and priced it accordingly I honestly can t help but wonder what happened to the band that gave us albums like Transistor where they billed it as a double album of 21 tracks to give value to the fans Secondly this album is mostly forgettable typical pop rock tracks that are full of filler verses that are often repeated and filler choruses that are simply sounds or one or two word stanzas that are repeated several times count how many times the word Weightless is said on the song of the same name it makes up half of the lyrics A lot of the trademarked 311 funk is either completely subdued or completely absent Once again SA Martinez plays the role of vocalist and hardly does any rhyming and when he does it s weak because the lyrics are weak The album feels slapped together as if it s a cash grab trying to get one summer season s worth of play before being taken out of one s playlist and forgotten This is nothing like old school 311 and anyone who says otherwise has clearly not listened to Music Grassroots or even 311 The Blue Album in a number of years On those albums SA Martinez actually rhymes with force and authority Nick Hexum flows both hard and mellow the funk flows throughout and the lyrics are mostly well thought out and meaningful Universal Pulse however is just like Uplifter and Don t Tread on Me before it ultimately forgettable and destined for top 40 radio play in a month or two If you MUST have any of these new songs and want the best the album has to offer save your money and just buy Time Bomb Sunset In July and Count Me In as individual tracks The rest simply aren t worth the purchase price Expand 2 of 2 users found this helpful var nr domain www metacritic com var nrelate dwparams mapp nrelate comptype widget comp 380

sessions for 1996 s Makaveli Record Label Interscope Genre s Rap More Details and Credits Critic Reviews Score distribution Positive 1 out of 8 Mixed 6 out of 8 Negative 1 out of 8 Entertainment Weekly 75 Too often here post mortem producers dilute his power with garish backup singers and pop hooks 4 20 2001 p 72 All this publication s reviews New Musical Express NME 60 So even the fact that these 29 tracks including 3 remixes have sometimes been re produced re jigged and finely honed production wise doesn t diminish the original effort involved All this publication s reviews Read full review The A V Club 50 Nothing here quite matches the sheer awfulness of its title track and first single which inexplicably samples Mr Mister s Broken Wings but the album is uneven throughout perhaps inevitably given its two hours plus length All this publication s reviews Read full review Sonicnet 50 The problem isn t so much that this album sounds dated not surprising as it was recorded back when Lil Bow Wow was in pre K but rather that the songs are so poorly mixed and produced All this publication s reviews Read full review Wall of Sound 49 Multitracked to death Until the End of Time

know what to expect but the first three episodes were mildly entertaining Thank goodness for DVR because I would definitely not stay tuned to this show through commercials I have no need to watch it live because this isn t something my peers are dying to discuss the next day Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful CCunningham 3 In a word boring I tuned in hoping to see some really cool whacked out

animated series All this critic s reviews Read full review TimeReviewed by James Poniewozik 80 The first episode is maybe to grab the young guy audience heavier on the sexplay and lighter on the

23 y o male and i grew up with Southpark and Family Guy but This Show is so Far past the Idiacrocy that made those two Funny for me The Language is a lttle stronge for Kids but i have not seen anything this Great in a long Time I literally have Teared from laughing so Hard This is one of the greatest animation adult comedies i have ever seen I am Literally Looking forward to every episode Keep up the Great work Expand 9 of 12 users found this helpful BananaMan 10 Archer is a brilliant show The animation is top notch and the story lines are extremely funny The wit and complex story lines brighten my thursday nights Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful ApoACD 10 Can t get enough of that show It s fun it s full of black humor and so crazy it hurts You get to love all the characters There is a logic continuity from show to shows so you need to start with the first episode Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful BeauB 9 If you like Fisky Dingo you are going to love Archer One of the funniest shows on TV 0 of 0 users found this helpful EatToWatch 9 All preface by saying this show is not for everyone In fact it s probably not for most people The humor is sophomoric incredibly so sometimes and the jokes can be a bit repetitive That said this is my favorite comedy on TV It s hard to review comedy as plot characters location etc all essentially don t matter to me Sure the music is good and the voice acting is wonderful but the real barometer and the one that earns this show a 9 from me is does it make me laugh The answer more than any other show on TV Archer is hilarious Season 1 is simply outstanding Watch a single episode and if you like it and the jokes resonate with you than you ll be in for a great season of TV Expand 5 of 5 users found this helpful ClamBuster 9 Where did this come from Late one night on one of the back end channels on Sky I accidentally stumble across 20mins of absolutely scream out loud TV gold Having just finished all 10 episodes of season one yes I went straight out and bought it the next morning I can safely say that this is now the show I declare the funniest show on TV and without any hesitation I can t even look at a picture of show lead Sterling Archer now without laughing to myself The shows premise is simple Archer is the main secret agent at his mothers international spy agency ISIS The remainder of the cast is made up of ISIS employees The agency itself is supposed to be professional but a control freak nymphomaniac mother a hot empowered ex girlfriend spy a wimpy sex addict accountant a weird strangle obsessed secretary a butch can t keep her mouth shut HR officer and numerous other hilarious characters all make a day at ISIS utterly compelling viewing The star of the show however and without question is Archer himself voiced by H Jon Benjamin who does an amazing job as do the rest of the ensemble cast a self obsessed womanising hard drinking spy with a habit of bragging about how good a secret agent he is Archer is adult comedy at its absolute best It s crude and offensive but above all charming The zingers come thick and fast and no episode outstays its welcome This animation party has just been gate crashed and for me Archer now finds itself as head boy Brilliant Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful SeymourDuncan 0 I ve watched this show straight

was hesitant having watched the one in the 80 s But I caught one episode the other night and now I am hooked It s different than the 80 s show so don t compare it similar in concept but different story The chemistry between the two leads is amazing and the rest of the cast is great Jay Ryan as the beast does a great job of balancing the conflicts of his beast self and that part of him that wants so much to be human And Kristen Kreuk is so amazing and a great example of a strong female lead empowered as a detective She is also struggling between this double life she leads and the price she is paying The romance is being played out wonderfully The show has lots of potential And each episode gets better and better Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful kevans 10 I Love this show Its

just watched Betrayal and I have to say it didn t surprise me not even a bit Some scenes are really beautiful and the idea is not bad the main characters do just fine enough sorrow and cry because they are cheating on their respective couples Is predictable made in an environment where rich people feel sorry for themselves so they look for someone that feels the same and you know what They meet in the first episode how convenient Like I said is predictable the dialogues are not bad they could be worse but I do not expect that is gonna get any better I hope I am mistaken though Expand 0 of 0

Helgenberger George Eads Summary CSI is an innovative new type of crime drama because the characters use cutting edge forensic tools to examine the evidence to solve the case Rather than a whodunnit cop show investigating witnesses suspects CSI explores the howdunnit CSI has been the number one scripted series in the Neilsen ratings for four years running In 2007 nearly 84 million people watched CSI making it the most watched show in the world CSI is now in its 10th amazing season Expand Genre s Drama Suspense Show Type In Season Season 1 premiere date Oct 6 2000 Episode Length 60 Air Time 10

truly captures the distinct feel of Vegas the night the gallows humor of grisly work and the people who thrive on it Sure it s seedy surreal and supremely specific That s why we re hooked 6 Oct 2000 p

StormMay 8 2013 80 CSI doesn t shy from the less savory aspects of the business it covers There are flashback cams that show the crime taking place and micro cams that look closely at the evidence But it s kind of tasteful if you can imagine and contributes to a Friday night show that is not only entertaining but might actually teach you a thing or two 6 Oct 2000 All this critic s reviews VarietyReviewed by Laura FriesMay 8 2013 50 But more often than not CSI isn t sure if it s trying to be intellectual or just sensational John M Keane s heavy handed music inversely proportional to the events onscreen doesn t help Subsequent episodes would do better to pull back on attention grabbing stunts in favor of the mystery and drama that lies at the core of this premise 4 Oct 2000 p 2 All

like to write a review Share this Starring Larry David Jeff Garlin Cheryl Hines Summary Each half hour episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm features verit style footage of David playing himself at home at work and around town as he gets into predicaments with fictional and real life personalities With cast regulars Jeff Garlin as manager Jeff Greene and Cheryl Hines as wifee Cheryl the series features appearances by guest celebrities playing themselves or character roles Candid unsparing and self deprecating Curb Your Enthusiasm brings the off kilter comic vision of Larry David co creator and co executive producer of one of the most lauded comedy series in TV history Seinfeld to HBO The series blurs the lines between reality and fiction as David playing himself and a cast of real and fictional characters are followed around Los Angeles by a ubiquitous camera that chronicles the private often banal world of a relatively public man Having evolved from the 1999 HBO special Larry David Curb Your Enthusiasm this series proves how seemingly trivial details of one s day to day life a trip to the movies a phone call a visit from some trick or treaters can precipitate a Murphy s Law chain of misfortune to hilarious effect Like George Costanza in Seinfeld the protagonist of Curb Your Enthusiasm has a knack for getting himself into uncomfortable situations that end up alienating him from peers and acquaintances To keep the narrative fresh and spontaneous Curb Your Enthusiasm is shot without a script the cast is given scene outlines and often improvise lines as they go The result is an unpredictable format that s unlike anything else on TV In Germany the show is known as Lass es Larry Stop it Larry In Portuguese the show is known as A Louca Vida de Larry Larry s Crazy Life In Norway it is known is Ingen grunn til begeistringIn Sweden it is known as Simma lugnt Larry In Finland it is known as J it hattuun Expand Genre s Comedy Show Type Between Seasons Season

2013 100 The improv based exchanges don t even sound showy anymore The regular cast members and even such recurring celebrity guests usually portraying pettier versions of themselves as Ted Danson and Richard Lewis have gotten so skilled at this unusual manner of filmmaking that Curb Your Enthusiasm feels almost like reality TV 13 Sep 2002 All this critic s reviews Chicago TribuneReviewed by Steve

races aren t all that fresh Yet I am engaged by the show s lively metaphor for a polyglot culture fractured by tribalism and Otherness for a world that can easily put aside past pain and present differences to tackle a common threat All this critic s reviews Read full review The Hollywood ReporterReviewed by Tim GoodmanApr 17 2013 70 There s a lot of genre bending in this one but some real

410MaXiMuS 10 We may just have a winner here I see tons of potential in this show I wasn t blown away by the pilot but I was very entertained and curious to see more after it ended I m rating this a 10 to counter the inevitable trolls that will come here and give it a 0 because it s a SyFY show Expand 13 of 20 users found this helpful Son0fSun 10 Ever since Syfy butchered the Stargate Franchise with Universe I have kept a long distance from any show on the network My roommate pointed this show out to me and was thoroughly impressed with the premise universe and overall feel of the series As a pilot I have to be fair to look at it as a pilot I took the liberty of watching the pilots of my favorite franchises to fairly compare this show to other franchises 1 Star Trek TOS TNG DS9 VGR ENT All 5 of these shows had weak pilots compared to the strength of themselves as a series when they ended their runs I ll never forget hating the DS9 premier so much as a young teenager it took 4 years for me to return to the series 2 Stargate SG 1 Atlantis Both shows had relatively mediocre plots and seemed very overly campy for my tastes Atlantis I didn t resume watching until the end of the first season because I felt so indifferent towards the season opener and although I did not catch the SG 1 premier until many years later it is among the strongest of the showings I have seen in the premier department I didn t mention Universe on purpose 3 Smallville VERY weak pilot honestly the entire first season pretty much served as the pilot The show didn t really find its footing until the second season It lasted 10 4 Firefly Strong pilot victim of Fox enough said here This show has a likable cast a strong underplot involving the former mayor and most of all a vast expansive believable universe It employs all of the things I enjoyed about Deep Space 9 Firefly and Stargate SG 1 In an entertainment world where things are very rarely original the premise of this show is one of the best I ve seen since Firefly beating other shows now considerably established by a long shot in both strength and viability at this early stage Expand 2 of 5 users found this helpful xGradiusx 9 It s been a while since I ve been this excited about a show coming out on the SyFy Channel The introduction of so many characters in the pilot episode sets the stage for some potentially great story archs for the future of the series The special effects in the show were not the best but they did the job fairly well When the pilot episode ended I was left excited for more Expand 4 of 8 users found this helpful AlphaBoss 8 The story and science fiction of the show are not of any major concern although some background information is lacking why did everyone decide to go to war and almost destroy each other why are the so many alien species all in one area of space why are these ships coming down from the sky why are their power sources so valuable However what s mostly lacking are some interesting and genuine characters I could predict almost all of the characters lines with no surprise at all I know they re not developed yet but the characters need much improvement Without this aspect being corrected the show is bound to fail 7 5 10 Expand 1 of 4 users found this helpful Dominee 5 The writers of Defiance created a complex and deeply rooted history for the show which appeals to some and not to others but beyond the history the stories in the episodes are poorly written The concept of running an MMORPG along side the series was a brilliant idea but the prices they are charging ruined it I am left with the feeling that the show itself is an extreme marketing campaign to launch the game Points received is for the complex back story of the show overall a 5 because the show is second priority Expand 6 of 9 users found this helpful Dukay66 4 Defiance has a lot of potential and it looks like Syfy is really trying to promote this show its already green lit for a second season But even with all the potential in the world Defiance feels flat tossed up unoriginal and boring The Pilot surprised me even with its clear short comings but I would go as far to say that the Pilot is probably the best episode so far out of the 6 that have aired For me the show is loosing a lot of steam and its steam that it never really had The alien races feel very unoriginal and arent even interesting they come off looking very odd and funny The acting is below average I feel like the man guy is the only actor who feels comfortable in the show Defiance is episodic meaning you dont really need to watch the episode before to understand the one your watching I kept on giving Defiance a chance and after 6 episodes I am now officially dropping the show Defiance is a chore to watch and is only worth your time if you like cheap Syfy Expand 2 of 3 users found this helpful B2UX 0 we all know the show is over period not one show has lasted through a year of silence it will become a

him He chooses the town of Everwood because his late wife had told him of her emotional attachment to it Many of the story lines deal with the conflicts of adjusting to a new setting as well as getting along with new people Dr Brown simply called Andy most of the time at first finds some animosity towards Dr Harold Abbott with whom his professional opinions differ However Dr Abbott s cranky demeanor and Andy s passive cheerful attitude prove to mesh well and the two begin a friendly rivalry Ephram continually struggles with his emerging adolescence his studies as a classical pianist and

BoedekerMar 20 2013 60 The show can induce cringing when Ephram and Andrew engage in overheated squabbling The nurse patly explains the problem when talking about another family When father and son don t get along it usually means they have everything in common The plot twists fit together too conveniently but all the actors do well despite the sticky situations The show s greatest asset is Smith who makes the son fascinating 16 Sept 2002 p E1 All this critic s reviews USA TodayReviewed by Robert BiancoMar 20 2013 50 Some shows are so syrupy you re afraid the tape will stick in the VCR

reviews Read full review Pittsburgh Post GazetteReviewed by Rob OwenMar 20 2013 50 Doc Brown has his own clashes particularly with Dr Abbott Tom Amandes the town s sole general practitioner before his arrival Abbott is a caricature over the top in his arrogance He does everything short of twirling a mustache to shout I m the bad guy This is where Everwood hits a bump With such realism in the relationship between Ephram and his father it s a shame series creator and writer Greg Berlanti Dawson s Creek went down such a conventional only on TV path in creating this other adversarial

Tss5078 8 A few years ago I was watching a very forgettable movie on cable so forgettable in fact that I can t even remember the name of it This film did however have a tremendous teen actor who I took note of because of the charisma and intensity that he brought to his role I thought this kid could one day be a big star and took note of his name Gregory Smith Since then I have become a huge Gregory Smith fan seeing most of his films and now his TV show Everwood The story of Everwood begins when world famous neurosurgeon Dr Andrew Brown Treat Williams loses his wife in a car accident Distraught Brown decides to leave his prestigious job and move his family from New York City to the small town of Everwood Colorado where he opens up a free medical clinic Brown was a brilliant surgeon but really doesn t have a clue about how to be a father His children in particular his son Ephram Gregory Smith does not make the transition easy on him To be honest this isn t the kind of show that I usually go for and I was only planning on watching a couple of episodes A couple of episodes quickly turned into much more as this infectious group of people really drew me into their lives and touched me in a way that a TV show never has Part of me could really relate to their personal struggles and attempts at overcoming the adversity they faced if nothing else It was empowering and inspirational Veteran actor Treat Williams leads a truly terrific cast playing the man whose turned his life upside down in order to get closer to his children Dr Brown is supposed to be the one who has all the answers at the hospital that may be true but at home it s a big learning curve for him The dynamic between this quirky celebrity doctor and his introverted yet artistic outcast son is really the heart of this show Gregory Smith is off the charts good as young Ephram Brown who possesses many of the same qualities as his father Those qualities are usually at odds with the qualities of his mother causing him to be a bit impulsive and quick to speak his mind Ephram quickly falls for the most popular girl in school Amy Abbott Emily Van Camp who is the daughter of Everwood s first family Amy clearly has feeling for Ephram but a shocking secret that keeps her from getting close to him Van Camp now the star of ABC s Revenge is asked to wear many hats sometimes she s sweet and innocent while at other times she s immature and irritating but no matter the mood she s always at the top of her game really letting you feel what Amy is feeling Amy s father is Dr Harold Abbott Tom Amandes who was the only doctor in Everwood until Dr Brown showed up Abbott is arrogant egocentric and absolutely hysterical Amandes brings some much needed comic relief to the show and his interactions with the other members of the cast are priceless If it wasn t for Everwood being a WB show Tom Amandes would have several Emmy Awards by now because he really is that good Everwood is a family drama that is at times hard to watch because you will be deeply affected by these characters and at some point will be able to personally relate to what their going through It pulls at the heart strings that s for sure but seeing that adversities faced by these characters and how they were able to over come them is really an inspiration I said earlier that this is the kind of show that I don t usually watch but it should be for the way it made me think and the way it made me feel Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful var nr domain www metacritic com var nrelate dwparams mapp

sky from me There s no place I can be since I found Serenity you can t take the sky from me Firefly is set five hundred years from today in a new planetary system after humanity abandons Earth That Was Under the leadership of Malcolm Reynolds a renegade who fought against the new unified central government the Alliance the crew of the Firefly class vessel Serenity struggles to survive any way they can They fly between the border planets to keep away from the Alliance and below its radar This series was described as a science fiction western but is different from other space based shows as it features no aliens For stations and individuals seeking the intended air order of the series as specified by creator Joss Whedon as opposed to the order Fox originally aired them or that they are informing stations is the order they should be shown in see here Each of the crew members has a special role Malcolm Reynolds holds the duty of Captain he is a defeated soldier who opposed the unification of the planets by the Alliance to no avail He strives to keep all his crew members on task and Serenity flying safely while trying to make a living and do the right thing in his rather flexible moral framework Zoe aka The Soldier is extremely loyal to Reynolds as she served with him during the war and owes her life to him Zoe has the strength and experience to take command of the ship if necessary Wash is Serenity s pilot and Zoe s husband unassuming self deprecating and calm with a sense of humor Kaylee is the ship s mechanic an experienced engineer who keeps Serenity flying Inara is a Registered Companion most easily described as a high priced courtesan or geisha She is also the person with the highest social standing on the ship and acts as the crew s Ambassador Jayne is the muscle of the crew A tough uncultured Mercenary unpleasant and offensively direct but loyal to those on his crew usually The newcomers are Simon Tam is the Doctor on Serenity and comes from a wealthy family and has a privileged upbringing He has spent his life savings and future to save his sister River River aka The Fugitive was experimented on by the government Her psychic visions a result of the experiments are taken at first as babble by the crew but they slowly come to realize that there s more going on than what shows on the surface Book or The Shepherd is a wise minister who knows far more about military matters and battle tactics than a man of the cloth should and his past is shrouded in mystery Expand Genre s Drama Suspense Science Fiction Show Type Ended Season 1

with engaging stories to tell 19 Sept 2002 All this publication s reviews Cleveland Plain DealerReviewed by Mark DawidziakFeb 23 2013 80 While often great fun the series premiere occasionally shows the strain of trying to blend all of those genres into one sleek package On the plus side of the Firefly universe the show is expertly paced and is full of those wickedly humorous asides that fans of Buffy and its ever improving spinoff Angel expect from the mischievous Whedon 20 Sept 2002 p E1 All this critic s reviews Chicago Sun TimesReviewed by Phil RosenthalFeb 23 2013 63 The characters

about it Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful PQuinny 10 This was a terrific show I just recently started watching it about a year ago and I was so upset to find it had been cancelled after the first season I mean what happened Fox Did you hire a bunch of morons who decided it wasn t good enough Joss Whedon did such an excellent job with the plot and characters of this show and it s a shame Fox had to ruin it Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful jsous 10 perfect smart funny action packed Such an amazingly enjoyable show I cherish the few episodes that were made because in my opinion they are some of the very best television produced Expand 10 of 10 users found this helpful AJRambo 10 Fun and adventurous following this incredible team is an amazing journey as you see the relationships that have depth and meaning Seeing the secrets of the team reveal themselves and characters grow and flourish is exactly what you look for in a show Expand 0 of 0 users found this

on board Serenity conversing with the characters They all have a special place in my heart I didn t know I could enjoy a show so much until I watched this Expand 1 of 2 users found this helpful ncoulombe 10 Absolutely amazing Truly clever writing great acting interesting stories superb cinematics This show is quite possibly the best show to be cancelled Don t listen to what professional critics say they are used to giving thumbs up to anything that fits in with what is the norm this show is breaks the mold and is definitely unlike anything else I ve seen on television Expand 4 of 4 users found this helpful SelnAdams 5 This review contains spoilers click expand to view You all are going to think I am nuts but I did not think it was that good It is not as low as The Avengers but it is just in between something and nothing But I will give the show the benefit of the doubt because of its unfortunate end The first season of any show is rough and to end it there is just plain sad Shows nowadays never get a chance to reach their potential not even the film Serenity satisfied me Some characters never get a chance to show their true colors except if you are the star of course and the Tam siblings even though Rivers character was so formulaic that I knew where they are going with this character and Jane Cob which despite one particular episode I did not find him interesting at all Kaylee was the only character that stood out from the crew it really was the performance that sold me Wash however was very hard for me to see because when he is not on screen I completely forget he exists As much as Jane is somewhat dull he at least is memorable And the pilot s death in the feature film while shocking goes over my head as soon as the next scene starts But as stated if not for the shows untimely end this review would be different The cast and crew should be fortunate that there are loyal fans out that will fall on to the sword for their success because honestly they would be dead and forgotten without them Expand 1 of 3 users found this helpful See all 31 User Reviews Related Articles TV Movies Ranked The Best Worst Movies Based on TV Shows Published June 8 2010 The A

formula Some may find it to be another cop show but like I said I was quite surprised I didn t expect it to grab my attention so much Expand 4 of 6 users found this helpful Navz6289 8 As soon as I saw the trailer for Graceland I knew I was gonna like it being a criminology student I liked the way they set it up with the FBI looking into one of their own but somewhere along the line I think they lost track of the plot It started of with this big bang and now it s almost as if they re trying to change their mind about what the show is actually about the agents or the criminals It started off being something different focusing on the struggle of undercover agents to maintain their morale even when being forced to fuse with California s criminal underworld The struggle that Mike has to deal with between doing his duty or his loyalty to the man who saved his life who may also be a dirty cop However this roller coaster ride that they have viewers on making us suspicious of Briggs then making us sympathize then making us hate him then making us like him is too much They need to save all the plot twists they can because there s only so many twists and turns that a series can take before it burns out like the others Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful nicole246 7 If you love USA type show beautiful people doing really interesting things then you ll love this show I personally think this one stands out because of it s combination of a normal procedural along with relationship intrigue I disagree with the other reviewers saying there is nothing to connect to with the characters or the story when I think the actors do a good job the stories tend to be strong and the drama is good especially for a USA show Give it a chance and you might find that you like it Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful mgyukeri 6 Graceland is good and that s probably the best thing I can say about it The cast is generally unremarkable and the whole thing has a very USA Network feel which isn t necessarily bad it just doesn t have any substance to back up the style Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful NotchFilter 3 Based upon the trailer I saw the premise of the series seemed to be good enough to warrant me sitting through the pilot episode I found the pilot to be entertaining I thought the speech at the graduation ceremony to be quite good But I just could not shake the feeling that the show wasn t good enough to justify the effort I would have to put into it in order to keep up with characters development the reality show style of angst among the characters and all the plot twists I made that effort with Burn Notice because I found that show to be engaging enough to warrant it With Graceland the formula is there but there doesn t seem to be enough substance behind it Expand 1 of 5 users found this helpful wordsilk 1 Unbelievable premised with unbelievable characters Not one character was likeable The actor playing Briggs is much too old to be a surfer dude Why can t it feature women as lead characters for a change or actors who are not impossibly pretty Expand 0 of 3 users found this helpful theasset 1 At no point in the pilot episode do you feel like you should be feeling anything for these characters characters who all seem miscast belonging more on a daytime soap Even the leader Briggs never comes across as even

Julio Oscar Mechoso Aimee Garcia Sara Paxton Summary In this autobiographical family comedy based on the life of series creator Peter Murrieta life is seen through the eyes of 15 year old David Tiant Pablo Santos as he faces the challenges of growing up in an ethnically mixed upwardly mobile family David s dad Joaquin Julio Oscar Mechoso High Incident Damon is a proud yet infuriatingly pragmatic Mexican American Joaquin s world is built on old fashioned values of working hard to get ahead taking care of your family and the one that causes the most trouble father knows best His wife Elizabeth Rebecca Creskoff Quintuplets is an Irish American who is fiercely proud of her husband and family David s cheerleading diva of an older sister Maria Aimee Garcia All About the Andersons is having a little identity crisis of her own rejecting her Mexican roots and telling people that the family is Spanish Also living with the family is David s irreverent Uncle Ernesto Jacob Vargas who is gainfully employed as an animal control officer yet tends to drift good naturedly through life having acquired three ex wives and a young son named Daniel Bobby Chavez along the way Little Daniel looks up to his cousin David and is in constant awe of his relatives new status as members of the middle class The matriarch of the family is David s free spirited grandmother Magdalena Lupe Ontiveros who is determined to escape the old folks home where her only entertainment is breaking every rule and move in with her beloved grandchildren Knowing that his mother will cause as much trouble as his teenage children do Joaquin has been fighting this move every step of the way Joaquin s recent promotion has enabled the family to move to a bigger house in a nice Tucson neighborhood and David is pleasantly surprised when his new next door neighbor Sarah Sara Paxton turns out to be not only a very pretty girl but a potential best friend At the center of this chaotic family circle is the relationship between Joaquin and David whose mixed heritage only adds to the eternal adolescent dilemma of exactly how and if he fits in Though he is secretly proud of his son Joaquin rarely shows it and his first impulse is always to criticize rather than praise Not really appreciating how bright David is Joaquin is convinced that without his constant advice his son is headed for disaster As with most father son relationships the truth is that they have a lot to learn from each other An unconventional family comedy Greetings From Tucson is from executive producers Rob LaZebnik The Simpsons Peter Murrieta Second City Howard Klein King of the Hill and David Miner for Turner Television Before Greetings from Tucson some of the show s titles were This Time and Just Like You Expand Genre s

Mixed 8 out of 13 Negative 2 out of 13 Los Angeles TimesReviewed by Howard RosenbergFeb 24 2013 80 Although Maria self consciously identifies her family as Spanish the series displays its Mexicana proudly and is just witty and offbeat enough to stand out from the crowd 20 Sept 2002 p C1 All this critic s reviews Miami HeraldReviewed by Glenn GarvinFeb 24 2013 80 Much edgier in confronting issues of class and ethnicity But it never loses its sense of humor 19 Sept 2002 All this critic s reviews Pittsburgh Post GazetteReviewed by Rob OwenFeb 24 2013 70 The composition of the cast and presence of a grandma Lupe Ontiveros makes the show structurally and thematically similar to ABC s George Lopez Show but Tucson is more entertaining and better written 20 Sept 2002 p 40 All this critic s reviews San Francisco ChronicleReviewed by Tim GoodmanFeb 24 2013 50 Despite some funny moments and undercurrents of real potential Greetings From Tucson has nothing special going for it other than being part of an emerging trend For it to survive the writing will have to be snappier and the situations more original All this critic s reviews Read full review Detroit Free PressFeb 24 2013 50 Alas most of the humor comes straight from the formula family sitcom factory Nice cast stale laughs 20 Sept 2002 All this publication s reviews USA TodayReviewed by Robert BiancoFeb 24 2013 50 Tucson is sweet and inoffensive and almost totally unamusing The best that can be said for the show is that it s better than the only other Latino show on network TV ABC s George Lopez Of course if that were the standard WB s sitcoms would all be classics 19 Sept 2002 All this critic s reviews New York Daily NewsReviewed by David BianculliFeb 24 2013 20 The jokes and the moral lessons are

banging on the house and the hostage team has to figure out how to dispose of him Cons The pregnancy subplot Unless they re held hostage for 9 months who cares Potential for too much family drama and needless distractions from main plot Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful JoyTheWizard 6 meh It s not that interesting it doesn t help that Tate Donovan is in it I mean he s a great actor but seriously he s in everything now It would ve helped if they developed the character more to make him different Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful AtariBaby 5 I tried to like this Right away you feel it s too over the top It s yet another show where everyone is in on a conspiracy and there are conspiracies inside the conspiracy But 20 minutes into the second show we ve got the assasination postponed two weeks and you can see they re already trying to stretch this thing out and it s annoying and depressing and implausible So ready to never think about this show again Bye Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful imthenoob 4 What little promise is shown during the beginning of the show is killed during the painfully slow second half Plot doesn t get interesting Side plots are generic and it really fails to capture you the way good dramas do That being said It s not a terrible show but I wouldn t go into it with high hopes either I d give it another episode or two to see if it improves but if it doesn t then I am done with it Expand 3 of 3 users found this helpful kram789 3 The opener left me flat I could not get interested in the mystery and nor the family problems It does not meet the threshold of being compelling enough for me to suspend disbelief Just not very interesting Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful joef123 0 Awful Im a big fan of Toni Collette and Dylan

more than a few nods to the Marvel movie history There is just enough CGI to be interesting and the ratio of reality and fantasy is perfect to keep you immersed and enamored And the casting of course is just perfect Expand 2 of 6 users found this helpful Fabiank2 10 Absolutely terrific Great pace awesome visuals a lot of references to the geek world and the Marvel Universe Agent Coulson is such a great character Whedon NAILED IT Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful techdude 10 Love it It had action lots of new ideas and references to the marvel universe The characters are pretty well defined and I think the nerd duo will work well after a while but my favorite was the Black Ops guy I hope the hawk shows up in the show because he is one of my favorite agents Every pilot has some bugs but this one was one of the better pilots I ve seen for a show Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful andrewgarcia732 6 If you can get past the cheesy one liners stereotypical characters and dialogue its not to bad I liked the references to the Marvel Phase One group of movies with plot elements like Extremis Don t get your hopes too high though for this though I think it s better than The Avengers and the show has potential My only big complaint is that its too unrealistic like with the little robots and the flying car at the end unlike the Marvel Cinematic Universe which is grounded in reality Honestly flying cars Joss Whedon It was kinda short and a little too fast but most TV shows are I think they should merge the Marvel One Shot Item 47 with this that would be cool Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful rmjbones 6 The show is totally cheesy and nothing original All the characters are the stereotypical characters such as tough guy assassin computer nerd tough girl with a past etc I just thought it was boring and nothing like the action packed movies Expand 2 of 5 users found this helpful munchy22 4 wow is all I can say That s not cause of the tv show Im a huge avengers fan and a Joss whedon fan by miles Yet the episode 1 of shield is pretty awful I m sure it ll get better but some of the lead chars are to happy with themselves and there s to many cheesy 1 liners I see a lot of people giving this show high scores but seriously and you all know this to be true but some of you are just not being honest I give it a 4 based on the over the top acting and to much time spent on trying to make it comical defiantly doesn t feel like a joss production but if it is then np im sure hell sort it and help develop it into a good series after all its only episode 1 and he gave us avengers and fire fly and buffy ect Soz joss had to give the show a 4 and I really didn t want too Expand 2 of 5 users found this helpful Arnoldthecow 0 I am not sure if people are joking when they say Marvel s Agents of SHIED is anything but terrible Everything that could have gone with the show did with bad acting bad dialog and horrific jokes It is like they took what was good about the avengers and made it really really s t Even Clark Gregg sucks dick in this which i thought would be the only redeeming factor but no The show as a whole is just plain bad with nothing that is even remotely good or even exceptionable from the people involved The amount of money just wasted on this is embarrassing and you who think they would get a half decent script together or one good actor in the mix but no they just spent it all on large set pieces and special effects which suck anyway Cheesier then High School Musical and not even as funny as You Me and Dupree this is a monumental

critic s reviews Read full review Wall Street JournalReviewed by Nancy DeWolf SmithJun 6 2013 70 The sets are somewhat spartan and the cast of investigators almost uniformly young and good looking a token geezer gets eviscerated early on never a good sign if big budgets and verisimilitude are your thing Yet the animals that matter look terrifyingly real and the prospect of watching the human cast try to put the ferocious visitors back where they came from before history unravels is exciting All this critic s reviews Read full review The Hollywood ReporterReviewed by Allison KeeneJun 10 2013 50

the original series look like King Kong by comparison not because the visual effects are bad but because the plotting is so wooden that the human characters are about as interesting as impalas grazing in an open plain All this critic s reviews Read full review San Francisco ChronicleReviewed by David WiegandJun 7 2013 0 This thing is so bad it makes SyFy s goofy piranha gator shark movies seem as

out of 3 missloladin 7 Frankly any critic giving this show a ridiculously low score or likening this show to other Syfy original movies such as Mothman or Mega Piranha is intellectually dishonest however I will admit that the show definitely had a slow and generally disappointing start That said the second half of the series offered generally good computer graphics as opposed to most Syfy movies which seem to shoot for the most unrealistic dinosaurs possible decent acting and a somewhat engaging story line if you can get past the glaring holes in the time space continuum story plot I at the very least appreciate Syfy s apparent attempt to create a new dinosaur drama While the show was not perfect at least it seemed like a good faith effort at creating something entertaining and in that regard they succeeded as the show was at times generally entertaining In that regard I am saddened that like other shows ahem Terra Nova what s in the badlands I will likely not receive the closure that I desire C est la vie Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful mrmonster 6 It had a slow pilot but it got better it doesn t have much story but the dinosaur action scenes make this show at least worth watching It s interesting but I don t think it will go very far Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful PainIntheAlice 5 Oh dear another decent show that didn t make it across the pond so swimmingly Shades of Being Human and Top Gear so sadly and badly misinterpreted by their U S production teams One of the original UK cast made a brief appearance in the first episode which raised my hopes a little but he soon vanished and the moment was lost At least we have the re imagining of the brilliant House of Cards but then again Kevin Spacey is almost a Brit these days Expand 0 of 0

working for me I was pleasantly surprised While not great a few holes in the characters and plot that weakened this episode I found myself drawn to the show and I am looking forward watching it again next week Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful Ariadne 8 Really interesting premise but I m worried it s going to be a supernatural soap Going right to thwarting the apocalypse doesn t leave a whole lot of room for growth I enjoy it now but if it goes on a winter hiatus I might lose my interest like I have with so many other soapy shows Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful scifigeek 7 We ll see how this goes but I liked the pilot overall You have to suspend your disbelief a good deal but only a little more than say some of those cop or doctor shows which are nearly as fantastical The pace was fast and the production and acting was solid and even has the promise of some good chemistry between the leads The writers seem to be blending in different ideas stories and worlds And I assume that in this alternate universe Irving never wrote the story of the Headless Horseman and Ichabod Crane I hope they can make sense of the stories and ideas as they go as there is the danger that this can turn into another Hero s Fingers crossed Expand 1 of 2 users found this helpful eeyore 0 So disappointing Feels cheap generic boring I lost interest in this series after 30 minutes of episode 1

Starring Gervase Peterson Joel Klug Jenna Lewis Summary The rules of Survivor are simple average Americans are abandoned in the middle of some of the most unforgiving places on earth Divided into teams they participate in challenges given by host Jeff Probst and every three days the losing tribe must trek to Tribal Council to vote out one of their own Halfway through the game the challenges shift to individual competitions when the tribes merge and become one Now the game is every contestant for themselves The game is simple Outwit Outplay Outlast by winning immunity thus not being eligible to have votes cast against yourself However the players must be careful about who they send packing because after the merge a jury of previously voted out contestants begins to form and each week they return to watch the Tribal Council ceremony At the end of the game they vote for one of the members in the finals to win one million dollars and become the next Survivor Generally each season begins with a twist something different to surprise the new castaways Survivor is a game of adaptation and the final two or three of each season are the players most able to adapt to their surroundings and to the people they are playing with Survivor focuses on the people and the social commentary that surrounds them The game revolves around how these players can Outwit Outplay and Outlast Expand Genre s Game Show Show Type In Season Season 1 premiere date May 31 2000 Episode Length 60 Air Time 08 00 PM More Details and Credits Critic Reviews Score distribution Positive 4 out of

World and the Discovery Channel s Eco Challenge with a big dash of Gilligan s Island goofiness thrown in for good measure 2 June 2000 p E1 All this critic s reviews Entertainment WeeklyReviewed by Ken TuckerJun 13 2013 83 Anyone who has worked in an office can identify with the tribalists permanent state of exhaustion and paranoid mistrust so Survivor s chief goal in the upcoming weeks is to make distinctive some of the initially rather bland seeming participants All this critic s reviews Read full review Newark Star LedgerReviewed by Alan SepinwallMay 7 2013 80 The show s aura of jungle mysticism is so overblown it s hilarious I love how the castaways have to kill rats for food and make fire with sticks but the tribal council meetings take place on a lavish obviously prefab jungle village set that looks like the Ewok treehouse city in Return of the Jedi The million dollar grand prize is sitting over in one corner of the set a pile of cash in an open treasure chest Very Scrooge McDuck Asinine stuff and intensely addictive 2 June 2000 p 37 All this critic s reviews New York Daily NewsReviewed by David BianculliMay 7 2013 70 Even if the supply of waterproof matches ran low these 16 abrasive Americans can be counted on to generate sparks merely by arguing with one another If drama equals tension Survivor is drama distilled and addictive 1 June 2000 p 100 All this critic

his father is a successful professional who is about to strike gold with his Gut Whacker and ride the 80s fitness marketing craze wave Corey finds it difficult to get in the game On the other hand

appropriately enough That 80s Show The anachronism filled followup launched amidst a tidal wave of publicity scored lots of eyeballs for its premiere and then promptly lost half of them A lone tryout broadcast after its parent series improved its standing and suggested the sitcom could thrive with some nurturing like That 70s Show had gotten but the short sighted executives who were running things at FOX Sandy Grushow and Gail Berman swept it under the carpet anyway like most of the shows they launched that season Much more interesting than the story of the show itself was the story of a little email battle that waged and leaked between co creator Mark Brazill and Judd Apatow who was doing another FOX show called Undeclared the same year after Apatow attempted to get That 70s Show star Topher Grace to make a guest appearance on his series Filled with such classy lines as Die in a fiery accident and taste your own blood and See ya at the upfronts bitch unless you get cancelled before that the tastefully restrained tale of lies deceit and alleged intellectual property theft probably got both of their shows cancelled without anybody ever bothering to look at any of the ratings

main character Diane Kruger is an autistic detective trying to solve murders around the border aka the bridge of Mexico At first you might be inclined to feel annoyed at her but understanding that she is autistic will hopefully shed some light as to why she acts the way she does for all viewers She is a very interesting character with some great potential for the series given how she acts around people There is a slight of humor to be found with Kruger in her interactions sometimes it can be difficult to tell if you want to feel annoyed or sympathetic with her which is a very unique juxtaposition The worst thing I felt about the Bridge s premiere was that the direction seemed confusing at times regarding the man who has a heart attack at the beginning A lot of importance is put on him and his wife and it didn t really seem to tie in to the main story early on There is a good climactic amount of tension at the end of the premiere episode but I won t spoil it for anyone Expand 1 of 5 users found this helpful iguanab 10 This is not another cops and robber TV show This show goes much deeper than Bang bang Shoot em up deeper It delves into the stereotypes Mexicans and Americans have about each other It also has as a main character a person with Asperger Syndrome Such casting educates society as to what Asperger is It is so much more than a cops and robbers TV show Expand 2 of 3 users found this helpful bdfink12 10 Honestly this show gets better every week and I haven t felt this compelled by a tv show since Breaking Bad Acting Writing and Directing are top notch Expand 2 of 2 users found this helpful Jshtjls 9 It starts out very strong and absorbing the mysteries was a little too typical for those who had watched show like The Killing It got similar premise of Who s killing who but what differs it from other cop drama was its atmospheric tone that it had and surprisingly compelling drama speaking about surprising the leading lady Diane Kruger was undeniably interesting to watch as this workaholic detective with little very little lack of empathy i never though that she could carried it through almost like Claire Danes in Homeland this series has it all from twisting mystery compelling drama and interesting character it depend viewer of whether or not they want to see something more realistic and dramatic show about cops and detective like this US version of The Bridge I know i do and eager to see how its slowly resolve Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful bob516 8 Diane Kruger s portrayal of Sonya Cross is what keeps me coming back each week I am not all that engaged in the investigation of the bridge murder hopefully that will change The character of Sonya can be funny and sad seemingly at the same time The idea of a detective with Asperger s syndrome lends itself to exploring a cop show with an entirely new light Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Jhwarfield 7 Aside from the confusing personality of Kruger which comes off as annoyingly overacted The Bridge is well acted the script and location are original and the pace is just about right I look forward to season 2 Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Bo33y 0 Why watch a show on cops if it is yet another clown act There was little to absolutely no realism in this show A pair of dumb and dumber doughnout eating coffee drinking smegs the equivalent to the fiction displayed Why are these morons in the literal sense handling any kind of investigation Look at the cliche of the police cheif No genuine forensic s on scene watch the body split in half not being noticed immediately no sniffer dogs checking vehlcies no chopper to pursue a would be suspect who was casually glanced by and then waved on being the nearest vehicle to the crime Her response back to the victims husband faceplam and not from a specialist This show is primetime The premise is of another serial killer dun nananana who stalks victims on both sides of the border So why have we got these fools doing the groundwork Atleast the serial killer will be so clever and it will take them an entire season of episodes to figure him out Make it past 15 minutes I dare you why would you want closure here and why would you want to see this 9 out of 10 coming from some people who brainlessly don t live in the real world This show is ridiculous and should come in warning to it s obvious

News Contra Costa TimesReviewed by Charlie McCollumJul 19 2013 100 Jammed with characters and story lines it has a Dickensian quality in its ability to capture time and place with precision It is almost never predictable avoiding the cliches of the Mafia genre even while it revels in them Just when you think a story line is going in a particular direction the show will suddenly shift gears and veer off into unfamiliar terrain without stretching plausibility to the breaking point 16 Jan 2000 All this critic s reviews People WeeklyReviewed by Terry KelleherJun 27 2013 100 Critics justly extolled The Sopranos for its brilliant blend of compelling drama and mordant humor and the first three episodes of 2000 contain no signs of slippage All this critic s reviews Read full review NewsweekReviewed by Mark PeyserJul 19 2013 100 It s every bit as addictive as the first year based on the three episodes given to critics Though the first installment is a bit choppy the second and third are filled with the kind of surprising stories nuanced acting and hard won redemption that make the show feel more like a mini movie than a mere hour of TV 17 Jan 2000 All this publication s reviews Arizona RepublicReviewed by Bill GoodykoontzJul 19 2013 100 Can the second season possibly be as good as the first Judging from the first three new episodes the answer isn t just yes The answer is that it might be even better 16 Jan 2000 All this critic s reviews The New York TimesReviewed by Caryn JamesJul 19 2013 100 Even this early The Sopranos has displayed the depth that is its most stunning quality All this critic s reviews Read full review San Diego Union TribuneReviewed by Robert P LaurenceJul 19 2013 100 Befitting its title The Sopranos plays out like an opera sweeping subtle currents change directions gradually but powerfully 16 Jan 2000 All this critic s reviews Orlando SentinelReviewed by Hal BoedekerJul 19 2013 60 I ll grant you the Soprano family story is vividly told and colorfully acted but the mob intrigue can be grim disturbing and tiresome 16 Jan 2000 All this critic s reviews See all 24 Critic Reviews User Reviews Write a Review Score

believable I m sure Italian gangsta wannabes imitate Hollywood fantasy Forgett aboudit Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful joeyperez 10 Every season of the sopranos is getting a 10 from me along with the wire you ask me why because i dont have an 11 button along with the wire one of the shows that completely revolutionised television there are others that can be compared even favourably and there are forerunners and worthy successors but these two shows pretty much dropped the bomb on tv the sopranos is better than the wire for me but its an apples and oranges thing this show is endlessly fascinating incredibly rich and effortlessly reflective of america itself the wire further deconstructed the episodic shackles of television and the idiot drive to pacify an audience but the sopranos owned the narrative perspective and the cynical portrait of the larger world it is set in we got to know the city of omars baltimore real well from watching the wire but tonys america is the world we are living in as american as the simpsons Expand 2 of 2 users found this helpful larrybird 10 fantastic sopranos 1 of 2 users found this helpful carloswalnuts 10 The best season of The Sopranos for me not only for its subject of gangsters but magnificent performances a plot better prepared than the first the appearance of one of the most charismatic antagonists that had The Sopranos Richie Aprile and of course the figure of Tony as the dearest Gangster tv a masterpiece Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful asylumspadez 5 This review contains spoilers click expand to view The first season was amazing but the second season was so disappointing You knew from the very beginning of the season that it was a build up to Tony killed Big for being a snitch The addition of Richie was a poor one I didn t care for the actor who played him and I felt that as a main sort of antagonist for the season he wasnt written that good Very disappointed with this season Expand 0 of 2 users

anxiety and tearful protests against being the next to die ABC s amalgam of drama murder mystery parlor game and elimination competition for money is a curious mishmash All this critic s reviews Read

toward the show s eventual payoff All this critic s reviews Read full review Pittsburgh Post GazetteReviewed by Rob OwenJun 24 2013 40 Whodunnit asks its contestants to become actors when they are chosen to be killed off which gives this show a cheesy vibe that s accentuated by contestants screaming at the top of their lungs when they find a body that they obviously know is just someone playing dead Add in pacing problems and reality show cliches and Whodunnit may prompt a big Who cares from discerning viewers All this critic s reviews Read full review TV GuideReviewed by Matt RoushJun 21

ReporterReviewed by Allison KeeneJun 24 2013 40 Though Whodunnit wants to give ordinary people the ability to step up and use their brains to solve a crime the results as of the first episode are

Mixed 1 out of 28 Negative 12 out of 28 wcwcaseman 10 It is sad that a show with with an interesting story line gets tossed aside because people can t rap their heads around it Honestly this was a great show that mixed religion with history and technology It had a similar feel to the short series revelations It involved an ancient society protecting religious secrets and the re emergence of the devil trying to gain the secrets Sadly between people either couldn t understand the show or expected it to be something it was not Also it didn t help that ABC debuted the show on a Sunday put the next episode and a Thursday then canceled it because not enough people watched a Sunday show on a Thursday I believe this show was set up to fail and that is so disappointing Expand 1 of 2 users found this helpful CitizenA 10 After watching the first two episodes how are people not interested It combines history with religion and conspiracy but makes you think I guess that s what it is The general tv audience wants mind numbing tv shows like The OC and Gossip Girl that are so useless and irrelvant because they can t use their brains past 5pm or out of school This has great potential if people give it a chance to air before it s cancelled Expand 2 of 4 users found this helpful javanut 10 The Zero Hour is a cerebral thriller which requires background knowledge and an enjoyment of history If you are under 50 then this will probably not be a story line that you can relate The premier is a good warm up and I hope like a lot of shows that once the cast works together for awhile and the writers get comfortable with the story line that both will improve I liked the cliff hanger ending of the first one and hope that each week it leave me wanting more Expand 5 of 7 users found this

Code stuff you would not enjoy this rubbish I have to be honest and say this show have nothing redeeming apart from that it s not longer Expand 4 of 7 users found this helpful noisnam 2 bad writing and bad acting i normally a sucker for mysteries kind of tv show but the writing is so bad that you can laugh on it for example ep3 the main char follows a lead from what he pick up from the ground then the female detective call him on phone asked him where he is he said 28th street then the detective ran out of the police station looking nervous and shouting right away HANK HANK omg he just talk to you on the phone u just cant wait until you get to 28th street and go nuts Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Heptite 0 Cheesy over dramatic mediocre acting and the typical type of series where the audience will be permanently kept on the hook without any actual plot progress or significant revelations Expand 0 of 3 users found this helpful See all 28 User Reviews var nr domain www
