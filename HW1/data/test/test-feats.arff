mechanics really make it shine over other titles in the genre The multiplayer is surprisingly fun and many FPS fans will find a lot of enjoyment out of the entire package I suggest giving it a try if you enjoy arcade style first person action All this publication s reviews Read full review Multiplayer itSep 27 2013 70 Alien Rage is a solid and attractive old school shooter but it s uninspired and extremely poor in terms of variety All this publication s reviews Read full review GameStarSep 30 2013 67 Quotation forthcoming All this publication s reviews Read full review Game RevolutionSep 25 2013 60 So I don t know who Alien Rage is marketed towards It s a completely capable and attractive shooter that does almost nothing special I had fun playing it but at this point there are other older games on Steam you can play for the same amount of money that I d recommend many heartbeats sooner All this publication s reviews Read full review IGN ItaliaOct 1 2013 55 The new first person shooter from City Interactive is not that bad for fans of old style FPS but the linear levels the limited variety of the locations and the average enemy intelligence are not flaws to be underestimated All this publication s reviews Read full review Canadian Online GamersOct 2 2013 50 Alien Rage could have been a very good old school shooter a la Bulletstorm but curious design decisions poor execution and a severe lack of polish mar the experience All this publication s reviews Read full review DestructoidSep 25 2013 30 The true tragedy of it all however is that when you cut through the glitches the mediocrity the sensation of standing on a fragile boat and the design s lack of commitment one can actually find a quasi competent first person shooter attempting to happen When it s not breaking itself for no reason Alien Rage does work All this publication s reviews Read full review See all 19 Critic Reviews User Reviews Write a Review Score distribution Positive 16 out of 19 Mixed 2 out of 19 Negative 1 out of 19 UltraRampage 10 Just awesome shooter Good graphics Good optimization Very nice to play I hope that the game will have a good sale and we will see a sequel It is even possible on Unreal Engine 4 Expand 7 of 15 users found this helpful R3cover 10 This game is not half bad for 20 The shooting mechanics are solid the score based perk system is a plus as well The difficulty sets it apart from some games because it forces you to pick are harder setting than easy or normal In the end the entire package is enjoyable if your looking for a good arcade style FPS that gives you a good amount of bang for your buck Expand 3 of 5 users found this helpful Martinezz12 9 I love multiplayer Its like UT3 Qake with awesome graphic I was missing that kind of old school games Single player is amazing lots of action and explosions Game is really hard i spent 6h and i didnt even unlock half of the levels Bossfights are a bit boring and long but except bosses i love this game Expand 9 of 15 users found this helpful ToBbErT 8 I give an 8 for the singleplayer Its a great action game that really keeps you interested till the end The story isnt that great but the game is all about the action A I could be done a bit better and ive encountered some bugs but for 20 euro its a great deal I had games for 60 euro in the past that dont even come close to this game Highly recommended Expand 2 of 3 users found this helpful gameplayhdpc 8 Good game with nice graphic and amanzing desig Perfect optimalization interesting campaign and very playeble multiplayer I bought this game for 12 and it was really great prize for a lot of content and gameplay what really gives us fun If you like old school shooters you can t miss this Expand 8 of 13 users found this helpful LiqMat 8 I die a lot in this game and that s what I like It is not dumb easy and is a blast to play Graphics are outstanding but I do experience some slowdown as some scenes get can graphically complex that tax my Crossfire setup I can dip as low as 18FPS at times Either way a great old school shooter for a great price Expand 5 of 8 users found this helpful alienrageisgay 5 I love shooters especially the one from the 90 s like Duke Nukem 3D Quake Doom Half Life Goldeneye and I also love Tacticshooters like thhe first three Rainbow Six Ghost Recon and Operation Flashpoint They were all a challenge on hard settings and I like a good challenge but Alien Rage ist nothing but unfair The fact that you die every 10 seconds at a boss battle doesn t make a game hard You don t gain anything from the death like in Dark Souls where you learn something new about a boss and can change your tactics But in Alien Rage you die so fast I shot the first boss down to half and wanted to change cover had full energy and I could nt run 2 meters till I was dead The most annoying thing is that the talking is also repeated every time you restart a boss battle Your character always says the same words and I hate something like that I turned down the voice volume in the menu Reminds me Prince of Persia The sands of time were you had to activate a machine and one of the guards screamed at every single move of the machine Careful Think about you re doing The graphics may be good and the controls work perfect but if you want a challenge play some Doom or Quake on hard Settings They may be hard but still fair Expand 1 of 4 users found this helpful See all 19 User Reviews Trailers Alien Rage Launch Trailer Play Video 1 35 0 views play now Alien Rage Gameplay Trailer Play Video 1

MeristationSep 13 2013 75 Arma is a great series with a very specific public and we love it for it but this entry would be better with a bit of evolution and lacks some important features It is still

fantastic product Can t wait for the DLCs and all the additional expansion This is WAR 4 of 8 users found this helpful Shottymonsta 9 Great graphics great gameplay improvements over previous iteration ARMA II Nicer UI vastly improved fps and optimizations over ARMA II No campaign at launch but hundreds of user missions and emergent multiplayer possibilities Campaign is coming episodically in 3 DLC s thankfully free charging would of made my score a 0 In no way is this game less than an 8 Expand 14 of 30 users found this helpful William ftw 7 To those who have played previous ARMA games you know what your getting into But for those who haven t the game is a gritty military simulation and is insanely complex for new players to the series However the best parts of the beta are when you sit back and look at the amazing world that the devs spent so long creating Although the game isn t optimized that well and there are few bugs here and there but these are things that i can overlook as game play is solid and is well worth purchase on steam Expand 4 of 9 users found this helpful laxentis 4 Pros Great graphics Giant terrain Cons Lack of content Bugs Lack of modding tools available ones are obsolete Lack of proper modding documentation Lack of support Expand 22 of 62 users found this helpful wasabi867 3 Ive been watching the developement since the start and all i could recall till this day were steps backwards Steps backward in performance AI overall engine almost everywhere It is still the same old bad performing arma engine Especially when you are a top notch AMD user stay away Clearly Intel was favourited here The gunplay still has that clunk ish feel to it and so on I cant give it a higher score then 3 this is rather a big hit in the face to me Expand 10 of 29 users found this helpful LTdaz 0 So much wasted potent It s obvious that BIS intended ARMA 3 to be more of a platform for the community than a game But without solid content on its own it won t draw many new comers and the higher system requirement will prevent some ARMA2 community from transitioning As a result ARMA 3 will be slow going 0 as it is now Potentially a 8 or 9 a year or two down the road when contents are there and the price drops Expand 2 of 8 users found this helpful See all 119 User Reviews Trailers Arma 3 Launch Trailer Play Video 2 01 0 views play now Arma 3 Community Guide

magic fan i still play it a lot semi pro but this game is super dope highly recommend it ohh and you can pretty much just go single player and never spend a dime i would recomend getting the 25 base package tought Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful BCNE 10 I ve been hooked on Card Hunter since beta I m hoping the game comes to mobile devices soon The only thing I would like to see a longer campaign map Expand 2 of 2 users found this helpful Radiant999 9 This game must play for CCG fans I ve been a fan of the genre since I first played MTG back in the 90ies but I quit because it was becoming too expensive I still like to play digital CCG though but most games are pay to win and offer very little content unless you spend a lot of money on them Card Hunter is completely free you can buy a club membership to receive 1 extra item after each battle but you won t need those at all The game itself is a superb grid based tactical rpg with a lot of focus on deck building through looting Many different enemies item combinations strategies and a huge list of cards make sure it never becomes repetitive Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Cazliostro 9 This is a near perfect game It is a balanced blend of CCG and tabletop strategy The game mechanics allow for a wide variety of strategies and every scenario in the SP campaign is its own little tactical puzzle to be figured out The challenge level is spot on with most matches coming down to the last few survivors cards and hit points an incredible balancing act considering the level of complexity offered by the variety of cards The art style and story of the game are spectacular and evoke a great deal of nostalgia for anyone who remembers the halcyon days of tabletop gaming in the 80 s and 90 s This was obviously a labor of love on the part of the developers and it shows The addition of more content and game modes will eventually make this game a 10 10 in my opinion Well worth playing Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Jimbo364 9 Probably the most fun and addicting turn based game I ve played yet The loot system is great cards are tied to items and there are many items to collect The campaign is very long with 40 levels and an additional 11 that you can buy The graphics are very fitting the gameplay is very deep and will make you think hard at times Multiplayer is fun although it could use more modes since it only has Capture the Point for now Overall a great game for any board game and or turn based RPG fan Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Kluge 2 Card Hunter is a CCG with items instead of a standard deck of individually selected cards Items function as coupled card packs where each item slot is an opportunity for putting new cards in a character s deck keeping in mind that you can only equip one item or coupled card pack there You control three characters with their own decks of which the cards have very standard CCG effects Battles work in a standard CCG way where you lay one card per turn then the other person lays a card At the end of battles you loot new equipment rather in a roundabout way new coupled card packs The p2w aspect is definitely there but the pay part isn t too horribly in your face after the hand holding initial section of the single player campaign though they definitely sell it and the singleplayer campaign can be easily played through without needing to buy anything at least as far as I went before quitting This is pretty much the game if you ve played a CCG you ve pretty much played this I didn t find anything particularly exciting about it and it didn t hold my attention I ve never had much interest in CCG so I ll beg pardon for the negative rating but this game did nothing to turn me into a fan of the genre as someone who very much enjoys other subgenres of strategy games Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful See all 10 User Reviews Trailers Card Hunter Official Trailer Play Video 0 35 1 view play now var nr

weapons and sliceable enemies Looking forward to more games from this developer Expand 38 of 44 users found this helpful Sovereignlol 9 This game is plain fun and gore that s the whole point nothing special besides fun The story is nothing special just funny the gore is awesome the fighting is awesome graphics are mediocre pretty good game would give it a 8 5 but that s not possible on metacritic Expand 3 of 7 users found this helpful Arkveveen 9 Quite honestly one of the best shooters to come out this generation which is something coming from the mouth of a fan of Battlefield 3 or other good military shooters Because hey Shadow Warrior has AIMING DOWN THE SIGHT mechanics for those who prefer precision shooting which is a mechanic I love as well but I mix it up in Shadow Warrior with the sword and firing like some sort of insane Rambo So don t despair Call of Duty fans But I cannot deny my love affair with nostalgic shooters that I played when I was a kid including the recent Shadow Warrior Classic Redux that I made sure to finish before buying this amazing game However we can t forget about Doom or Duke Nukem 3D either Shadow Warrior does EVERYTHING right regardless of the supposed level design issues despite said levels being beautiful and wonderfully varied Here is why the game is good before I go off on further tangents Insane levels of depth with weapon upgrades skills and powers with each requiring their own resource to upgrade that you can find in the world Insane value as the game is lengthy as Lo Wang s um wang with about 17 levels chapters Explosive bloody and gorey combat that is too much fun whether or not you prefer using magic sword or other weapons like the PDW SMG which is my favorite weapon Fantastic humor with Lo Wang s classic one liners and quotable quotes Insanely good visuals Numerous visual options to help balance beauty and performance including the extremely underused TRIPLE BUFFERING option Field of view slider included for even the most discerning first person shooter fan Secret areas Did you think they would leave out fun to find secret areas that are actually TOUGH to find Well think again Now that is my review of Shadow Warrior Is this game perfect NO but it is as close to perfection that we will get in a shooter these days Expand 10 of 13 users found this helpful Odins Path 8 Great Fun the game doesn t take itself to seriously making for a very enjoyably experience Really its the Asian duke nukem with the one liners and over the top weapons Expand 5 of 9 users found this helpful orctown troll 7 Like it or loathe it GTA V has created a NEW 10 10 benchmark for game design And Steam discounts have reset our standards for game pricing The question is no longer how good a game is but how long you should wait to buy it Shadow warriors is a lot of fun It s in the mold of Painkiller and Serious Sam or even the old Duke Nukem games It s linear and long winded It s full of hidden things which should motivate some replays Gameplay is a blast and this game should eventually find its way into everyone s Steam library However it is nowhere near the standard of GTA V And at present it is overpriced You want to support the developer buy it now You want to examine at your leisure wait till next summer Expand 2 of 15 users found this helpful CriticoDubioso 0 No optimization for quad core tri core will have same performance as quad ones no official SLI support Potential FPS drop on some scenery due to lazy work on poor optimization Game play is boring and linear player still have to keep on

different games to choose from run and gun action titles to slow paced tactical shooters focusing on strategy and tactics but now most shooters follow the same model of big set pieces regenerating health linear levels and cinematic experiences The realistic tactical shooters with in depth planning have almost entirely disappeared in recent years This project working title TAKEDOWN aims to change that This game the spiritual successor to games like the original Rainbow Six and SWAT series will focus on realistic weapons modeling squad based play in a close quarters battle setting To succeed in this game you need to take things slow study your plans and execute flawlessly If you get shot there are consequences You wont be hiding behind a wall waiting for your health to regenerate If a team member goes down you will have to assess the situation and reallocate team members if necessary to complete the mission Don t expect all of the tools and plans to be forced fed to you it is up to the player to ensure their team is equipped and ready for the tasks at hand AKEDOWN is a thinking persons shooter The player that takes things slow aims carefully and plans their moves right will overcome the player who runs in with guns blazing Close quarters battle brings the fight inside as you would see SWAT teams or SOF units taking down small numbers of dangerous adversaries Non linear environments allow for multiple routes and tactics and add replayability The operation to clear pirates from a hijacked oil tanker by Russian special forces in May of 2010 is a perfect example of the types of missions in TAKEDOWN You will plan your insertions and routes before going into the scenario outfitting your teammates with weapons and equipment of your choosing and then execute the mission If one of your team members is killed they are gone and you have lost their valuable experience so you have to be careful Gameplay modes include single player co op and competitive multiplayer If you are a fan of old school shooters where thinking meant more than running and gunning or perks or if you are just looking for something different in your shooter games experience this is the project for you Expand Developer Serellan LLC Genre s First Person Shooters Cheats On GameFAQs Rating M More Details and Credits Critic Reviews Score distribution Positive 0 out of 8 Mixed 1 out of 8

bugs are seriously hurting the game it has dumb AI connection problems in both multiplier and singleplayer enemy and teammate AI is terrible If you were hoping for the next tactical shooter game then do not expect this game to be it it isn t it s a good game but not great Expand 2 of 20 users found this helpful mwak 3 I have some relations in CQB specialists I must admit this game is an hardcore FPS but not a tactical one Let me explain why the game mechanics are totally flawed CQB must be quick and you work with a team mostly 2 or 3 team mates It fully works with vocal communication and fast but precise reactions For example the way you penetrate a hall with 2 doors there is more than one way to do it BUT any time everyone will act as synchronized as possible First case everyone follows it s leading element and follow a wall with for each a NON CROSSED cover AI are really dangerous Second case one takes left two take left three covers the back Etc etc etc NEVER as in NEVER fire if you have a tea mate in sight basics always cover YOUR sector even if someone fires the opposite way Moreover in real life you lean eventually not a full lean even when walking you take different stances you use different movement speeds you can pre aim your weapon you use the wall as weapon stabilization so many small features that could have made this game unique I m really sorry guys but ArmA III is a better from really far tactical shooter even CQB than this This game looks more like a cheap unreal tournament mod or Source engine mod than a professional game You should have sticked on a rainbow six remake Anyway i laughed hard in front of some AI reactions enemies or teammates so that allows you a three Expand 8 of 8 users found this helpful JasonHansley 1 The game is horrible i dont believe im writing this because i was hopeful in the past about the game it really looked good and all and the way the devs were talking about i was waiting something like rainbow six 3 mix with new elements But it all turned out to be pile of junk not to mention horrible AI and horrible levels I got it on early access and i know i cant refund My thoughts if youre making a game make it but dont release on early access half broken at least make sure your game is 90 done Steam shouldnt allow this kind of games on Early Access Hope you make something better in future Expand 12 of 12 users

back your money if you request Do not buy this game Expand 2 of 2 users found this helpful Leshy 0 TRS has brought us the worst attributes in gaming from the early 2000 s I was looking forward to this release being an original Rainbow 6 and SWAT fan this game just disappoints The poor interface horrific AI Scooby doo style level design and Steven Hawking style voice chat who had that brain fart of an idea Claiming the use of VOIP is necessary to get the most out of this is a poor excuse especially when 3rd party software is required I was really looking forward to this but its so poorly executed even Ding Chavez couldn t rescue it Expand 12 of 12 users found this helpful cosmitz 0 Let me just say that i was a serious backer I knew the risks but the vision seemed clear enough Sadly the execution is a horrible uninspired mess It can t even be saved since it lacks any real features that would even define this game as a tactical shooter The AI is non existent really wire bots in CounterStrike 1 6 seemed more realistic there is no real way to loadout and manage your team and overall i can t find anything to recommend this aside from maybe saying it looks nice The weapons feel like utter garbage and the only real mechanic they tried sound detection isn t even working One hit dead is rare mostly ending up soaking 4 5 bursts before dying and even so without any injuries The game is a glorified tech demo that i wouldn t pay 1 for I have Android games that are better shooters as a whole than this Just stay away it won t get fixed and don t let ANYONE trick you into buying

improved and also borrows some from both Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3 Now when anything dies there is an X and a millisecond of blue screen GTA V is about 3 protagonists Michael De Santa retired bank robber and family man Franklin Clinton Los Santos native and gang banger who wants out of small time and Trevor Phillips a phyco drug dealer and Michael s former partner in crime Each character has their own skill set and special ability Michael can slow down time while using a weapon and has a higher shooting skill Franklin can slow down time while driving and has a higher driving skill Trevor can take half damage and give double damage while in combat as well as having a higher flying skill All of these skills can be increased by use or lessons Missions can be started by one character and be played with another and can be switched between Los Santos is a very large city that is filled with very colorful npcs and random events It also takes up about one third of map The rest of the map is either small towns or wilderness filled with animals These animals can be hunted by Trevor and pictures of them can be sent to a friend of his after a stranger mission Other stranger missions can unlock other side missions and activities The world of San Andreas is the largest map Rockstar has ever made Many types of vehicles can be driven including boats cars helicopters and planes finally There are many fun things to do and see in GTA V including one time when switching to Trevor he was riding a scooter shouting SCOOTER BROTHER at another scooter motorist Some pop in is a small sacrifice for such an amazing game Expand 0 of 2 users found this helpful TheOnlineGamer 10 Perfect Game for the Current Generation I played a lot of games with a lot of hype built around it and I d say this is the first game to truly exceed my extremely high expectations Everything R tried to accomplish they hit a bullseye with The scope of Los Santos is the largest of any game made period The world is full of possibilities and things to do unlike GTA IV and it is endlessly fun like GTA San Andreas The characters are the most developed and interesting in this one than all of GTA Next to Niko Bellic The story has some of the best set pieces and hilarious interactions seriously this is one of the funniest games I ve ever played Playing the game is exhillieratingly fun and Epic everything feels refined and realistic such as the Car driving which is now completely enjoyable The score is brilliant graphics breathtaking gameplay over the top ridiculously fun and the amount of hours you spend on the game just flys by This is not only my favourite in the GTA franchise but one of my favourite games of all time You done it again Rockstar Games job well done Expand 90 of 144

plots Los Santos is also a very beautiful city and large I think I shall not dwell on gameplay too much since the reviews should be on every gaming site Thank you rockstar for this gem I will always buy another GTA title Expand 0 of 2 users found this helpful Sangrient 10 Excelent videogame the best grand theft auto game of the year Expand 2 of 8 users found this helpful dadum 10 The transmission between the characters is well made the city and the surroundings look absolutely stunning the story line is compelling Gta V simply is one amazing game Expand 8 of 24 users found this helpful sityoazzdown 9 if you see the score for the critics review you ve thought this was the best game ever made It s an amazing game but I would nt say it s close to a 10 as all the critics say I respect that rockstar could ve just tried the same formula like in all the others gta s but decided to change it up with three characters in the game which brings variety in how you do missions However I just did nt get attached to the characters and story like i did in gta 4 mainly because you switch between characters The story is good but not great The gameplay was also tweaked with new special abilities which was a good change of pace The driving feels a lot easier to handle which is not really an improvement or neccesarily a bad thing The huge world is huge however I never found the drive to fully explore inside blaine county nor hunt animals I also felt like they juiced the cops too much and it s no longer fun to mess with them Everything else is what you expect repetitive strangers and freaks except for a few long story relatively good missions beautiful cars and graphics fun to drive around and explore It s GTA they never had a bad one and this is a great game just not a masterpiece Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Pinnapocalypse 0 Oh boy The hype for this game was so extremely forced I thought it was a joke at times But to be honest It turned out quite badly even while it does many things right such as the open world enviroment the interesting story and a fantastic attempt of immersion It kinda falls apart from the ability to jump inbetween 4 different people in the chest high wall coverbased shooting combat the moronic repetitive AI extremely scripted singleplayer missions and overall physics controls To be more specific GTA 5 does many of the mistakes the last XCOM did such as having little to no realistic proportions when it comes to physics which can be seen in the very first hour of the game where you enter a car chase and slam a low riding SUV police car from the side with an old family van model and It goes flying off the road as you remain completely untouched without even the suspensions reacting to pushing 1 2 tons off the road like a sack of potatoes or how you have next to perfect grip with said old family van car on an incredibly icy dirt road at max speed in the middle of winter But what really stuck out for me is the script and the overall consistency An example would be minutes after starting you re speeding down the road away from a huge shoot out and you meet cop cars going the opposite direction in the other lane One of your buds thoughtfully gives the comment of Oh they don t know It s us so pay no mind as rightfully so the cops ignore you fully until 15 seconds of driving ahead there s a huge police blockade that starts to fire at your car with everything they got the very nanosecond they see you Another example would be how they sometimes give you tutorials to do things AFTER you ve done things like the case where you fly your first plane I know It is not a deal breaker but It s something that interferes severely with the overall consistency with the game and combine that with the physics FPS lag moronic AI and you ve got a streamlined product that has been both overhyped hastily made for the masses and for that It gets no points from me Nor should It get any from you Expand 6

Simply the best Visual Concepts seems to give us a quality NBA 2k14 this year and intends to rely on it for entertainment obviously very successful on a slightly more intuitive gameplay and the presence of European teams rather interesting Remains to be seen what care has been given to the next gen versions Expand 0 of 2 users found this helpful 342171840 10 It seemed absolutely identical to last years NBA 2K13 until I actually played it Defense is better than ever much more challenging more modes than 2K13 and the improvements they made make this game the best basketball simulation ever Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful sand36cf 9 The game is amazing i m a NBA gamer since early 90 and since I play NBA2k every day since 2k8 2k14 seems to look like 2k13 but it s way more improved then the last years edition He defense is finally really good That was my main hope for this year The players body model looks way better and there are a lot of new animations MyCareer mode has not been improved in a way I was hoping for but still it s good But the PRO s play Association right Playing this mode is much more fun and complex by the improvements of defense and using screens Now having Tony Allen or Iggy matters more than having Novak or another shooter on the team Finally I can build a balanced team and not only focus on offense which was the case in 2k13 I know we all were hoping for more changes this year If they changed the menu would that change something Does Fifa14 has much changed since Fifa13 if you re NBa junkie like me buy NBA2k14 it s the best sports game ever Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful jc3485 0 I learned my lesson after buying NBA 2k12 only to have ALL online features shut off the moment 2k13 was released It s a rare thing indeed to find a game company that cares even less about the buyers than EA but Sega apparently is one of those few The sad thing is the games are good but I m not going to give them any more of my money if that s the way they treat their customers Expand 1 of 7 users found this helpful elouis652012 0 It looks like the exact same thing as 2k13 They haven t changed much and it s obvious that there was a tremendous lack of effort on the current generation games Expand 2 of 3 users found this helpful Theredfish 0 This game is almost identical as last years version as far as looks and My Player I was really disappointed when i got this but maybe they are holding back for next gen The controls are awkward and while there is some improvements on how it feels I cant get past the lack of effort on 2k s part They obviously didnt read anyones WISH LISTS on My Plater I certainly hope they improve all of this on Next Gen if not Its on to NBA LIVE 14 So do yourself a favor and just save your 60 dollars and keep playing 2K13 ohh by the way all that VC you bought last year doesn t transfer So yeah save your hard earned money Expand 4 of 7 users found this helpful Fishersam 0 This is 2K13 version 1 1 for an extra 60 Dont waste your money They must have put all of the stops into the next gen version of the game because i dont see any of the stops here It doesnt even run smoothly on the Xbox Are they

ball including how it moves and how players use it Trueball Tech allows the player to trap or knock on a pass using the analogue stick with detailed bar centric physics determining the weight shift of the player and the height and speed of the pass as to how the player s body will automatically shape to receive it Trueball Tech adds more freedom with full 360 degree control within several yards around the player and the ability to shield the ball from opposing players use deft controls to wrong foot them and intuitive methods to master close control Expand Developer Konami Genre s Soccer

battle going forward All this publication s reviews Read full review Gamer nlOct 2 2013 75 On the field we run into a more complex and deeper game in which it s all about patience and steel nerves

that much is obvious All this publication s reviews Read full review Gameblog frSep 19 2013 50 This new PES 2014 has made efforts in its gameplay offering freer and more realistic actions but it

different skills of each player and sometimes strangers mistakes like real soccer match Ok somethings are not so good but the gameplay is attractive and intuitive Soundtrack different with opera and funny songs Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Vandiel 8 Great Game the new fox engine comes to play an important part in the detail level of the animations and in the player physic s The loss of some stadium in this new edition feel s like a backstep but not a great one most gamers are confused by the low level of detail in some players faces but Konami said prior rel ase that they rel ase in the next week s a patch to improve this part of the game most important the game feels like a real football game the stadium the crowd and the in game mechanic s work well some minor bugs may appear and some framerate issues have been reported and konami is working to on a patch for this so overrall this PES feels like is in the good road to make the franchise the ultimate football game and retake N o 1 from FIFA in the next years to come Expand 1 of 2 users found this helpful luksonije 7 PES 2014 I expected a lot In terms of mechanics and gameplay I got a lot The players move and approach the ball more precise and with more understanding of inertia and mass movement physics laws However the acceleration of player is really turbo charged and it is easy to escape the opponents Unless they touch you If that happens you can play with Aguero and slow paced Terry will be able to slow you down Every single time So what is the point of speed if you only need contact to stop players Goalkeepers are terribly modeled Opponents shoot long balls in the box and goalkeeper is standing in his box too lazy to step forward The man marking is not good as well Somehow nobody is following attackers List goes on So what is good It actually feels close to real football match with real players At least one step closer Graphics is pretty decent as well What is bad Fake clubs names lack in tactical gameplay opponents can sprint for an hour and make pressure on your last line Like they are on doping And major minus in Goalkeeping I ll give it 7 of 10 and uninstall it Still believe that FIFA will be better Expand 1 of 3 users found this helpful sub zero 3 pes mengecewakan pergerakan pemain yang lambat membuat kita sulit untuk mengekplorasi skill para pemain pes 2013 jauh

i am alive i played countless hours of pes reaching top rankings having fun whit frends and then this comes out that for me ruined the franchise When i first started playing everything seemed normal when the game started the menu was different it was a little bit strange but i went to play master league and become legend everything was missing the cutscenes the talking everything that made the game fun it was not there and in the match the game just was horrible bugs everywhere and the grapich were horendes but how much i hate this game at the same time i love it this broke my heart i was not expecting such a tthing from you konami you were the best in football games in this game you went the fifa way and they you failed miserably and teh worst thing is every player llooks dam the same i went to fc london to rename it and make my own club and every onfe of the players was same i cud not recognize them this game is dissapointing in every level if you are a fan and a newbe so it deserves a 3 and this is coming from a old fan of the franchise dissapointed Expand 4 of 9 users found this helpful reddevilv7 2 PES 2014 is worst PES edition ever New engine made it worse Comparing with PES 2013 Graphics worst Skills worse and slow cant realize who is better Copycat of FIFA dont know which fifa but the fact is PES gone to FIFA rout and if that we PES FANS wanted we would have converted to FIFA Commentary same as PES 13 no development and FIFA is much better in that area Atmosphere a bit better MANY MANY MANY little details yet to say but I leave it to KONAMI studio My guess if they make next year same BAD game or if we dont see real touch development then I can assure that all will play FIFA soon RIP PES Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful arielarias 0 EL PEOR

something exceptional All this publication s reviews Read full review Vandal OnlineOct 1 2013 88 From the very first video you already knew whether Rain was for you or not It s short and simple Actually it s always trying to tell you what to do next preventing you from even attempting to think how to solve a situation which is something hard to understand and annoying But if you can forgive this you ll live an experience that no other game can give you All this publication s reviews Read full review MeristationOct 1 2013 85 One of the most sensible experiences of the year RAIN is pure feelings in a simple tale of boy meets girl and scape from monsters The shadow of ICO is undoubtedly planning over SCE Japan Studio s new creature but the makers of Puppeteer manage to give its creature an unique personality Beautiful lyrical and extraordinary deep in feelings RAIN makes itself Debussy s Claire de Lune to touch us and make us part of its own rain All this publication s

value I ever recommend this type of games are really pleasant Sorry forr my english and greatings from Spain Enjoy this game Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful palladiondsw2 8 In short Rain is beautiful short sad and immersive Like every game it does come with flaws the main ones being how short it is and once you beat it that s pretty much it however if you can immerse yourself in this beautiful stunning world then you will come out of this game like me amazed Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful NikoPwr 8 This is actually a really fun game Well part game and part experience It doesn t let you stray too far from the main directive but it is a great experience Whether you buy it full price or at a discount this is worth every penny Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful iBash 4 Sadly rain doesn t make anything out of it s interesting wet vs dry concepts instead let s you walk through an extremely linear gameworld and do the same simple boring and uninspired stuff you ve done in too many similar games before Push a box here to climb up there Pull a lever here jump there The graphics while pretty are technically surprisingly weak and the story is exactly what you d expect The solutions to each area are obvious but the game still holds your hand throughout the game and tells you what to do before you even get to try anything It s not that you can t have good moments with this game it s just that it s so forgettable and uninspired Expand 0 of 3 users found this helpful See all 5 User Reviews Trailers Rain Launch Trailer Play Video 2 04 0 views play now

game than its already excellent predecessor The game is absolutely filled with things to do and the new open world nature of AC is a blessing There are almost too many upgrades gadgets and secrets in the game and trying to remember combos is a challenging but welcome exercise in hand eye coordination at times Adding to a decent length campaign are hundreds of Riddler challenges numerous side missions balloon popping dive bombing challenge maps and a short fun stint as Catwoman Amazing Expand 32 of 37 users found this helpful mowino 10 Arkham City is easily the best superhero film I ve ever played and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys a challenge With Riddler s challenge and side missions u will get easily distracted LOVE It Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Gamertag gone 10 Probably one of the best sequel games every made Arkham City brings Batman OUT of arkham Asylum and gives you the free roaming capabilities that everyone was wanting from the first game The combat has been tweaked and is better than ever Nothing feels quite as good as countering three different goons at once and slamming all 3 of their heads on the ground Rocksteady NAILED this one I m officially a fan and will buy the next game they come out with JUST because of how well designed this one is the voice work is perfect the graphics are incredible The side mission don t feel like side missions the riddler trophies are back and more sinister than they used to be There is a TON of batman fan service and the ending to this game is one of the best i ve seen in the past five years Well done guys i m giving this game a well deserved 10 out of 10 Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful B1C BO1 10 I have just played a complete playthrough of this game it took 6 minutes for me a serious gamer to complete If you want a game that is for BEGINNERS and KIDS then waste your momney on this if however you are a serious gamer like me buy a game like big rigs otrr bf3 or skyrim Expand 2 of 3 users found this helpful seannydrama 9 Overall amazing game It struck a good balance of keeping the things that worked in Arkham Asylum the same but changing enough things that this game felt new and better Some of the villains felt a little diluted because there were so many but it s a minor gripe The fighting style is something you will either love or hate and falls in the easy to learn but hard to master cliche The primary story line felt a little short but there is enough to do around the City that keeps you busy for a long time This game was a blast and worth every penny Expand 0 of 0

of 0 users found this helpful Tylerhan2000 0 While Asylum was one of the best games I have played Arkham City doesn t live up to it unfortunately The sandbox element doesn t feel very good The grapling hook doesn t work half the time the fights are quite silly and not very challenging The best part about the game is the voice acting and story And that are the two aspects I care the least

addicting with a nice learning curve no platforming fan should miss this Controls the tightest I ve had for a plat former since super meat boy Great art style Hilarious and quirky sense of humor with a great story Level editor and community content Many different modes to play Incredible 4 player coop Massive customization options Yea buy this its even more perfect and bursting with content than Castle Crashers the Behemoth s last game Expand 9 of 13 users found this helpful colin8166 10 This game is an absolute masterpiece Hilarious creative and stupid fun Way better than Castle Crashers and Castle crashers was great Hatty Hattington rules Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful williamwiggles 10 This game is amazingly blended and combines the elements of puzzle action comedy and parkour so smoothly Consisting of an amazing and stupidly hilarious storyline in depth level editor and great multi player this is easily one of the Behemoth s best products yet The money system works on gems and yarn which are assorted through each level With these you can buy new faces or tools and weapons I instantly found myself scanning every corner of every level to find more gems for that new random face This game is only 15 dollars and worth the price for sure With the ability to play other gamers playlists the replayability is infinite I think anyone who buys this game will have a joyous time Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful jettman0 9 Very fun game to play especially when you re with friends So far I ve played several levels and I m having a blast One aspect that definately adds to the fun factor of this game is the humour This game is hilarious From the opening cutscene which is honestly the funniest thing I ve ever seen in a game throught the rest of the game the developers are trying to make you laugh It s fantastic and helps the game feel like it s less about getting your money and more about helping you have fun Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Tacobadgers 9 The multiplayer in this game is amazing fun it s platforming multiplayer at its best While I loved the addition of multiplayer to Mario games there s just something about them that is a bit off you have to share the screen when you jump on each other it almost always results in the other persons death and subsequent placement in the immunity bubble of doom it gets annoying really quickly and it becomes prefferable to play by yourself or just leave the other person in their bubble as long as possible with this game cooperation is critical and so much fun with plenty of opportunity to be a prankster while never punishing you too badly GO BUY IT its so worth the money This is one of the largest arcade games ive ever seen and I have a ton of them It was over a Gig of content for about 15 bucks that along with a robust level editor this game is totally worth the money Everything in this game oozes style and attention to detail Expand 1 of 2 users found this helpful TyvanJ0 9 Quite a lot of levels and stuff to do with friends There is also a simple forge mode to make levels and stuff for your friends and the world to try There are two main reasons I only give this a 9 The in game currency is based on new levels played so if you re replaying it with a friend its not for the money Also some levels are confusing very hard or impossible if you do one thing wrong Other than that the cut scenes are funny and man insane mode is crazy Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful StarlessBB 5 Does almost nothing new for the genre of puzzle platformers and feels way too old and generic Everything seen here can be seen in other platformers dating back to the 80 s That said multiplayer and a robust level editor will keep you busy and there are several premade levels and lots of costumes Considering the studio that made it and the amount of time it took for this game to be made I expected better Expand 2 of 15 users found this helpful See all 23 User Reviews var nr domain www

characters It doesn t work as well as it needs to Booker DeWitt ably if not unremarkably acted by Troy Baker would be a fine figure in a novel or a movie But in a game driven by his relationship with Elizabeth Bioshock Infinite snags on the issue of a third person protagonist in a first person game What does Booker look like How does he feel How is he reacting to what Elizabeth tells him What does he do when I press X to comfort Elizabeth Is there any subtext when he makes a choice How do they look at each other An actor s face belongs here There isn t one All this publication s reviews Read

when it came out in 2007 That the pace of the plot evaporated after the twist mattered not one jot the game delivered deep in something sadly missing from many games today atmosphere Bioshock 2 I also enjoyed in 2010 with the way that it opened up more and gave a spin on events in Rapture of its own accord but it never stunned like the original After seeing the first trailers for Bioshock Infinite 2 years ago I was hoping for something that would deliver in all key areas of a great game i was not disappointed Presentation is generally excellent for the 360 the loads being minimal and fairly fast The graphics are beautiful in the way that they are executed and the imagination behind them and if there is the occasional pop in of objects or textures and an odd moment of frame rate stutter it never affects the gameplay Sound design is on another level though completely the voice actors do a sterling job the sound effects are eerie in their delivery and coupled with the amazing soundtrack which at times evokes memories of Stanley Kubrick s The Shining amongst other things The soundtrack is a loud cluttered and often blustering bundle of objects that does what its supposed to it fills in the spaces that the graphics depend on to deliver the whole feel so to speak And so to the gameplay which is where I have to state that this latest entry in the Bioshock series truly is the best so far There are a handful of neat gimmicks put into the game at key points the skyhooks the tears in time which when coupled with some familiar aspects the vigors you may have seen before and the weaponry makes for some compulsive First Person shooter gameplay however the final ingredient the one that makes this game truly great and probably one of this years best and probably the decades I m going to state right now is the plot thundering through on some riffs from Alan Moore think sparks of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and Watchmen and some very clear influences from Terry Gilliam Brazil 12 Monkeys and many more I could mention the whole thing moves from scene to scene and never ever detaches the player from the game I ve said this before but if this were a book the whole thing certainly feels like a graphic novel you d be up until 4 in the morning reading it The last time I played a game that truly made me want to get to the end to see the whole thing and know what was going on so much was either Shadow of the Colossus or Half Life 2 so I think you can understand how highly I rate this game i could write more but alas I m on my second playthrough of the cursed game you see and I want to get back to it so I ll finish with this it is the best single player campaign game I have played in years it threatens to overflow with the wealth of ideas bursting forth and even if you don t think you ll enjoy it you have to give it at least a try One utterly superb game Expand 31 of 44 users found this helpful horsemann12 10 I am a huge fan of the series but it s safe to say that BioShock Infinite tops everyone of the other releases First I would like to say that the ending it provides will give you a headache but blows your mind at the same time BioShock Infinite is one of the only games that has taken a step back from the other games and succeeded with a fairly different type of game This game keeps you amazed and excited the entire ride If you haven t played go out right now and buy it Expand 0 of 2 users found this helpful Valiko 10 This game is extraordinary and really does deserve all the praise It has a solid story line and has smooth controls that work well Bioshock Infinite captures all the fun things we love in a shooter well balanced action and lots of ways to kill especially the vigors Expand 1 of 5 users found this helpful Govenah 9 Well just like you d expect I m giving Bioshock Infinite a high score Not because of the overhyped persona the intellectual and pretentious appeal or the figuratively and literally paradoxical conclusion but because it touches base with something all gamers want in a game ingenuity I speak biased when I say This is GOTY or You just don t understand the subtext because we generally develop diverging tastes in our games One of the main reasons why there is some criticism on why gamers and critics bicker over it s overestimated story like what happened to it s predecessors But like any high hitting game this game followed a formula most games aren t willing to take and in the end was relatively successful Expand 0 of 2 users found this helpful IProCF19 9 Recommended to Fans of the original Bioshock FPS fans and people looking for an immersive single player game to sink plenty of time into While Bioshock Infinite does not make huge changes from the original game s formula it s still an amazing game that takes your breath away at how it looks feels and plays The story while confusing if you don t pay attention or you didn t like your High School science classes is well told and explained by the many hidden collectables throughout the city and characters Columbia while sometimes feeling more like a floating ghost town than a thriving or collapsing urban city during the game looks stunning and when done right like a real city Sadly this real city feel is lost quickly as the story progresses Booker DeWitt gives the player a very interesting twist on the usual tough guy who regrets his past protagonist with some good depth in his character as well adding even more to the story Elizabeth while being a great companion in general has a few problems in her AI that make her feel a little fake at times and can remove you from the immersion for a while The enemies in general are nicely made with a brain on their heads on Medium and can be pretty cunning on hard One enemy the Siren acts more like an annoying bullet sponge than a tough enemy making the part of the game where you fight her a painful drag The levels even though they are linear are made very well and sometimes feel like you are playing in an open world game instead In short this game is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination Bioshock Infinite is still an amazing game With its great story addicting combat and a city in the skies that blows you away this game is definitely a game of the year contender and shows that the sky is not the limit for the infinite possibilities of fun and entertainment that you will get from this game Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Steveico 7 Bioshock infinite is a good game It is not great but it is good The game had beautiful visuals and a unique art style Game play wise the game was OK It is like a normal FPS shooter which has a cool new feature with sky lines that you can travel through the battlefield quickly Story wise the game is great The end actually makes you think and actually feel some emotion for some of the characters The reason I gave this game a seven is because I felt like it was a bait in switch from the E3 demo The demo showed a very expansive environment that you can traverse and it made it seem like the game was sort of open world The enemies also introduced at the E3 demo don t play a big role The boys of silence and the siren are just bosses that appear once in a specific stage I also got very annoyed when the game recycled the same boss three times to explain some backstory to the player You only see the handyman four times In my opinion the game is worth playing for story but not for gameplay Expand 4 of 9 users found this helpful Arisleitner 0 This review

a living unique and unpredictable FPS experience After your plane crashes into icy uncharted waters you discover a rusted bathysphere and descend into Rapture a city hidden beneath the sea Constructed

little girls loot the dead and genetically mutated citizens ambush you at every turn Take control of your world by hacking mechanical devices commandeering security turrets and crafting unique items critical to your very survival Upgrade your weapons with ionic gels explosives and toxins to customize them to the enemy and environment Genetically modify your body through dozens of Plasmid Stations

relationships with one another that impact your gameplay experience Experience truly next generation graphics that vividly illustrate the forlorn art deco city highlighted by the most detailed and

exceeds it through simple old fashioned talent and imagination not to mention verve style class wit and sheer bloody minded ambition It takes the tired worn out FPS genre by the scruff of the neck

refreshing has an amazing storyline aswell as an amazing atmosphere and setting Enjoyable combat maybe a little bit repetitive for some the game paces well too Expand 19 of 20 users found this helpful TristonDaShorty 10 The most beautiful wondrous and creepy place in video games Rapture Exploring this world is a ridiculous amount of fun The game revolves around you a nameless character running around this world and shooting down countless splicers and big daddies while the story progresses Your goal in this game is essentially to escape rapture after your plane crashes and you get stranded there The shooting is fun as hell but not the traditional accurate rambo fest that Halo and Call of duty players are used too Its a lot of fun taking down big daddies which are kind of like mini bosses and to take one down requires lots of ammo which compared to games like Halo and Call of Duty is pretty scarce Running out of ammo is a constant problem and you can purchase it from little vending machines or just find it around You will not be out of ammo for long but in the midst of a fight with one of the big daddies this can be a problem And dont for a second think that just because this is a First Person Shooter means this doesn t have an incredible story because thats what I liked most about this game The game has steller voice actors that create compelling and believable characters There are very few cutscenes in the game and the story progresses over the radio while your still playing If you doubt this system at all like I did dont Its awesome This game is fantastic and ends with a steller boss fight that I wont ruin for you Go buy this game now Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful JohnN 10 I love it Playing now The creepy ballroom dancing music reminds me of

moments when playing Bioshock where I just stopped to admire the detail and effort put into Rapture The only gripe I have with this game is the hacking system which while novel at first gets very annoying very quickly This is a must play game and one of the best FPS games to date 9 4 10 Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful pessimist 8 Overall a very good game I ll start with the goods the game has smooth controls and decent combat However where this game really shines is in the entire enviorment The world is just eerie which is what it is trying to do It s very mysterious yet also gorgeous The enemys are very creepy as well Plus there is an suberb plot And there is collection of individualist and objectivist philosophy if your into that kind of thing The only downside to this game is that it is a tad short and some of the animation isn t the best That s about the only bad thing Overall i would rent this game but not buy You could probably finish this game in 7 11 hours so there really is no need to purchase Defienetly try it though Expand 0 of 3 users found this helpful SaudAlmoayed 0 Actually i prefer super mario than this fucking stupid ugly game its much fanfooneeta

distribution Positive 12 out of 13 Mixed 1 out of 13 Negative 0 out of 13 EddieHokie 10 Tiny Tina is probably the best addition to The Borderlands Universe so I love seeing a DC centered around her The graphics are unique much like Hammerlock s DLC was but the story and exploration here is sooo much better It s the first time in a Borderlands game where I don t feel like I am thrown into a sandbox area and its refreshing It actually feels like a linear adventure with little side roads along the way which is refreshing to the usual Borderlands game dynamic of grab quest run either north east south west to complete and then backtrack to complete quest It is easily the best DLC to Borderlands 2 I would rank them as 1 Dragon Keep Fantastic 2 Pirate Captain Scarlett DLC Good to Great 3 Torgue Campaign Average to Good mainly because of Mr Torgue 4 Hammerlock Forgettable other than the graphic design Expand 9 of 10 users found this helpful salatir 10 One of the best gaming experiences I ve had in a long time I grew up with old school RPGs and Dungeons and Dragons and as an unabashed geek loved the inside or not jokes that permeated the game You can tell that this was a labor of love for Gearbox as they incorporated new not reskinned character models great voice acting and homage to tropes spanning the breadth of geekdom From the New U station snarking At least it s not too easy to orcs screaming at Humies to the spatula samurai that reminded me of Kingdom of Loathing to well there s a lot to appreciate And appreciate it I did The gameplay was challenging but what drove me to marathoning through the DLC was the story Gearbox did a great job spotlighting Tiny Tina more than the game or previous DLCs without a doubt she s still the same what did she just say character you remember but also a child mourning the loss of friends and escaping the flood of emotion through her imagination took that part from the Escapist but it s so very true As a working professional with a family I have very little time to enjoy games as I did when I was younger I made a point to stick with this expansion after the first 10 minutes And the game rewarded me for it with challenge laughs bittersweet reminisces and nostalgia aplenty Thanks Gearbox Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful GarryRyder 10 Best ever DLC of all other DLC s made for the Borderlands 2 This DLC is great Love the storyline Exploration s unique I ve endured one of the true noble gaming experience of Borderlands 2 Great DLC Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful somethingguy912 9 This review contains spoilers click expand to view Well It seems Gearbox had saved the best DLC for last not to mention saving the time necessary to put all the love and care into making this the panultimate DLC despite being a DLC merely focused around a D D esque board game ran by Tiny Tina best of all this DLC seems to borrow all the best things about the previous DLC s and puts them all into one frothing pot of humour gameplay mechanics and a surprisingly warm hearted ending too From Pirates you get the retextured chests with a cutsy wootsy small sized chest but with a new texture animation from Campaign of Carnage you get a return to fashion for the steriod infused manly man Mr Torgue and from Big Game Hunt you get a combination of stylistically daring landscapes a new palette of diverse enemies and the aesthetic combined with it But what Assault on Dragon Keep brings new to the table is a self awareness of the NPC s playing a board game as you get to see Tiny Tina hilariously create the game and story on the fly and many returning characters like Ellie and Angel are introduced in a new fashion Also Vending Machines are now made to look ye olde style including a palette of new voice overs for each one There are also now Eridium Slot Machines stylized Tiny Tina style with cupcakes and bandit masks and the like Also to influence the whole D D style there are new Roll Die Chests where the quality of items merely depends on the roll and you can increase the chances of the quality of goods by spending eridium to roll 2 die Also there are shrines that you can also spend eridium on to get different kinds of abliities like increased damage speed defense or restored ammo With these it improves the consistency of Eridium as backpack SDU s will eventually all be spent and Raid Bosses will eventually not be worth your time This perhaps almost saves the pain of not being able to use vehicles in this particular DLC which is really a minor complaint at best There is also another new chest that spawns good at the normal random chance but with a added surprise mimics the storyline with assault is really what you d expect from a D D styled game more or less satirizing all the things about those kinds of board games but moving through the story you start to notice Tiny Tina s strange denial with realizing Roland is dead where at the beginning makes you think it s merely for the humor but overall in the ends comes down to the idea that she made the game as a way to allow Roland to be alive in this universe which is actually a quite strong message about grief and moving on Also you will be playing the DLC almost familiarly like in the original game s plotline except for a slightly faster paced D D style version as you quest to kill the handsome sorcerer or essentially another 20 minutes for you to love hating Handsome Jack in this new style But perhaps the most epic thing that for some may or not be very important is the whole queen mythology with the queen being none other than Butt Stallion the diamond pony that Jack had told the Vault Hunter he bought right around the begining of the Vault Hunter s quest Sure it seems like an unimportant cameo but I was dying to actually see the diamond pony in person and the fact that a unicorn like that is the queen of this D D experience ironically makes the whole plight of saving her JUST THAT MUCH MORE WORTH IT seriously the fact that the pony is in this game is worth getting the season pass entirely This game not only redeems Gearbox for their previous disappointing DLC but also has enough leg to carry on as the best DLC Gearbox has made for the Borderlands franchise since Armory of General Knoxx I also enjoy the hints at the end for a possible fifth sequel where you may or may not be allowed to infiltrate the hyperion space station ON A MOON that would be awesome anyhow this DLC does everything right in every way with a nice heart warming touch with Tiny Tina accepting the loss of Roland and growing from it excellent job Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful hatethisnamesod 9 Once a year there comes a DLC that is truly brilliant This is the DLC for 2013 It has some of the best quests to come to Borderlands 2 including a quest where the Vault Hunter slaps a Joffery look alike Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful rob nancekivell 9 This review contains spoilers click expand to view My favourite of any of the borderlands dlc so far A tongue in check poke at elements of the roleplaying fantasy world with an oddly touching back drop of a young girl dealing with the death of her hero

Ratings Would you like to write a review Share this Summary Xbox Live Arcade Braid is a puzzle platformer drawn in a painterly style where the player manipulates the flow of time in strange and unusual ways From a house in the city journey to a series of worlds and solve puzzles to rescue an abducted princess In each world you have a different power to affect the way time behaves and it is time s strangeness that creates the puzzles The time behaviors include the ability to rewind objects that are immune to being rewound time that is tied to space parallel realities time dilation and perhaps more Braid treats your time and attention as precious there is no filler in this game Every puzzle shows you something new and interesting about the game world Braid is a 2 D platform game where you can never die and never lose Despite this Braid is challenging but the challenge is about solving puzzles rather than forcing you to replay tricky jumps Travel through a series of worlds searching for puzzle pieces then solving puzzles by manipulating time rewinding creating parallel universes setting up pockets of dilated time The gameplay feels fresh and new the puzzles are meant to inspire new ways of thinking Microsoft Expand Developer Number None Inc Genre s Platformers of players 1 Player Cheats On GameFAQs Rating E10 More Details and Credits Critic Reviews Score distribution

the wonderfully fateful day I saw it on the marketplace Braid is one of if not the most beautifully crafted game of all time Never before have we seen such backdrops characters and music blown into one nirvana The story is ahead of almost all other games as no other game that I can think of has left such a masterfully written story that has no definate meaning or answer True talent comes from letting your audience interpeeret the ending The puzzles are simple yet they will make you think in ways you probably haven t before You ll always end up saying Wow How did I not see that and the end

need to play the full game before reviewing it The only gripes I have about the game 1 Although the story can be interpreted as masterful there is not enough details to portray the story this way to everyone 2 The game is very short I completed my first run through in about 6 hours 3 Achievements were too easy to get I enjoy having games that have challenging achievements This was not the case as every achievement except speed run was completing a world Other then that the game looks great sounds awesome and has innovative fun gameplay Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful MitchellM 0 Despite

s single player campaign unfolds the player is introduced to new gameplay at every turn one moment you are fast roping from your Black Hawk helicopter after storming into the war zone with an armada of choppers the next you are a sniper under concealmenent in a Ghillie suit miles behind enemy lines the next you are engaging hostiles from an AC 130 gunship thousands of feet above the battlefield Mixed with explosive action Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare also delivers special effects including use of depth of field rim lighting character self shadowing real time post processing texture streaming as well as physics enabled effects Infinity Ward deployed a dedicated team from the start to deliver a new level of depth to multiplayer Building on the hit Call of Duty 2 online experience

publication s reviews Read full review G4 TV 100 Rarely does a game shine in every area and accomplish everything it sets out to do Call of Duty 4 is unquestionably one of those rare titles It may not revolutionize the shooter genre but it comes damn close to perfecting it All this publication s reviews Read full review TeamXbox 97 An instant classic The fact that Infinity Ward has created a modern day masterpiece probably isn t surprising given their impressive track record to date but our lofty expectations were actually surpassed in many ways The single player game was particularly surprising as none of us expected the game to have such a compelling narrative driven campaign It s one of the best stories of the year All this publication s reviews Read full review IGN 94 Though the single player lacks length the multiplayer should keep you invested in COD4 for the long winter This is a truly fantastic multiplayer offering that s as deep as any other online game available All this publication s reviews Read full review Electronic Gaming Monthly 92 Add to that the experience and reward system 16 maps out of the box and the party system and COD4 delivers a knockout one two single

you Issue 26 p 70 All this publication s reviews Destructoid 80 The game is short While that may be an illusionary side effect of the intense plot you ll be wishing for more when it finally comes to its thrilling conclusion Also the title is incredibly linear It offers the spectre of choice in some missions but when compared to the recent BioShock you realize you will have seen the entire thing

of 326 KingerSays 10 Please do yourselves a favour and ignore the bad reviews given by users on Metacritic In my eyes this is one of the best multi player games on the Xbox 360 today and is still highly populated after four years of release If you do not own it do yourself a favour and BUY IT Also notice that the vast majority of negative reviews on this website are given by either Battlefield or Halo marks noticeable by their names of their suggestions of HALO is better etc Expand 7 of 9 users found this helpful DavidGagen 10 I never played a war game in my life until I played Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare and let me tell you this game changed my perspective on First Person Shooters completly Its single player might be a little short but the online most certainly makes up for it This game encouraged me to buy more First and Third person shooters Any gamer who owns a PS3 Xbox 360 or even a PC should definatley purchase this award winning game Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Anonymous 10 Best FPS on the current generation of consoles hands down 0 of 1 users found this helpful Matriix 10 best multiplayer game of all times it was an instant classic the only thing thats really is that everyone cheats nowdays you cant play a game in public without 3 4 players are floating in the air and stuff however the first 2 years with this game was amazing Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful JacobM 9 I agree with what some people have said before the multiplayer is what keeps this game popular almost 2 years after its release The campaign is average and was not engaging enough for me to want to play through it again except for getting some achievements However the online multiplayer is insanely addicting and fun i was not a fan of FPSs and was horrible at them until i played CoD4 online multiplayer Yes some of the maps are taken right from the campaign but to me that doesn t matter They are still very interesting and make the online game play unpredictable Both the campaign and the online multiplayer are superior to that of CoD WaW in every aspect If you don t know which one to buy certainly buy CoD4 WaW is garbage compared to this game However Modern Warfare 2 is coming out in less than 4 months so you should probably save your money for that game Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Nlwt 8 By far the best CoD game I ve played and to say it was released in 2007 is very very impressive Thought the storyline was one of the best and the online is great despite the modders which is the only thing that ruins the multiplayer but that has nothing to do with the game itself The graphics aren t the best but don t forget this isn t a new game Activision really put other game developers to shame when they brought this out and I thought they let themselves down with the release of Black Ops 1 2 Ignore the haters on here they re clearly just fanboys of Halo or Battlefield that hate this game because it is AMAZING and popular something they will never be Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful JohnD 0 I have both systems and the reason I give this one 0 is that the PS3 version is just superior compared to this crap X360 just can t handle what the COD throws at it framerate drops graphics are good but not when compared to PS3 version Also the controls felt better for me with Sixaxis Iin conclusion if you have both systems get the PS3 version Expand 0 of 7 users found this helpful See all 326 User Reviews Trailers Call of Duty Elite Metaphorically Speaking Play Video 2 32 2 views play now Call of Duty Elite Trailer Play Video 6 40

everything that was good about the first one and adds to it I m sure there are balancing issues that people will complain about but I haven t found any at this point Spec ops is a ton of fun with a friend Not too fun single player This is easily a 10 just based on the value that I will get out of this Anyone giving lower than an 8 is just a fanboy of Halo KZ2 UC2 etc This is a great game that will keep me playing for months and months Expand 7 of 9 users found this helpful JacobW 10 Although the singleplayer is short it has an amazing story and is also fun It s a good example of where the graphics and gameplay is today Multiplayer is amazing just like CoD4 but has added in many new weapons perks and also deathstreaks I don t understand why people are giving this game a low score because this generation of gaming is about Multiplayer Why should games that have amazing multiplayer and a decent story deserve a low score when good singleplayer and no multiplayer games deserve a high score Ask yourself this before voting which lasts longer multiplayer or singleplayer Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Konstantinos 9 This game has all the ingredients that a shooter gamer wants The single player campaign is an experience which any gamer will enjoy even though they re not fans of games like this When campaign finish and this will happen very soon you can choose to play alone with a friend or online the special ops and you will spent a lot of your time in this I can promise After this however the most interesting part of the game comes with a playing time that overtake the one of campaign and special ops together and this is the multi player I hope that you can play online because this is the special reason that Call Of Duty is famous Great graphics sound and gameplay for you to enjoy and a beautiful way for new shooter gamers to love more games like this Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful WyattTheAwesome 7 Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 has a fantastic campaign and added to it s replay value without needing an internet connection by adding Special Ops or challenge missions that offer new levels of difficulty and entertainment When it comes

for its very fun campaign and Spec Ops Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful WhovianFantatic 5 This game was not as good as world at war but still ok its fun but unamusing the ending is stupid and

the first 2 weeks it was good apart from the campaign that had a million plot holes eg shepard said the world watched as his men died in cod 4 they didnt The sas and USMC led a joint offensive against the men reposnsible and obliterated almost all of them and thats just one plot hole Secondly the multiplayer Poorly done maps loads of glitches unblalnced perks and weapons the reviewers were so obviously bribed or fell into the hype Shame Get COD 4 or Black Ops they are MUCH better Expand 1 of 7 users found this helpful AndrewT 0 It s a really good game Single player is really similar to

insane and stupid this game is the EXACT SAME THING as diablo 2 just 3d and the setup is different but overall the 2 games are alike and its a GREAT addicting game ESPECIALLY in co op wth give blizard a break they diud an amazing job they respected diablo franchise and history so whatever haters are everywhere thats nothing new phew Expand 2 of 4 users found this helpful kolin1302 10 This game shines in the local couch play Gather 4 friends or family members and have fun in a never ending dungeon crawler to hunt for loot and Gold while drinking and laughing at ALL the Blizzard hating trolls with no lives outside of their mental state This game is simply dynamite a family that plays together stays together Let s rock and roll and loot Expand 12 of 18 users found this helpful azure908 9 First of all ignore all these scores under 5 and their reviews They re all haters and trolls from the PC version whose only purpose is to troll Diablo 3 without stop With that being said Diablo 3 is a great game from a casual gamer perspective and it plays absolutely well on the console For 60 USD the game has provided me more than enough hours of entertainment more so than the just released Saints Row IV Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful Bru 8 The console version of Diablo 3 is a step up from it s PC predecessor There is no auction house there is offline play and you can play with 4 players co op on the same screen People could argue you could just play PC without the auction house but that would be silly because the option is there It would be like playing an RTS and not using a unit because you think it s too strong As for the co op there is nothing quite like sitting on a couch with your buddies playing a game It is a social experience better than having 4 people in the same room but with laptops Some cons are the redial menu it s not bad I just preferred the PC s version and there s a lack of things to do once you beat all the way through it such as a lack of a ladder system like in Diablo 2 Nevertheless Diablo 3 console has a Champions of Norrath style of gameplay Expand 6 of 8 users found this helpful BatFat09 8 Meh this is a pretty good port of a pretty ok game I wasn t expecting much but the same console coop that this game has is what made diablo fun for me again Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Johan701 0 It s funny how after the clear huge and astonishing fail of critic reviews that happened in the pc version critic rate 88 users 38 They are just giving no f ks and still voting this horrible game so high I see user score is higher for the XboX version probably because the user base is way more casual than the PC one If you ever played diablo 1 or 2 you will get so much disappointed that it will hurt If you never heard about diablo 1 and 2 and or you are just a casual player that never really played an ARPG hack n slash you might find this pretty enjoable Still being one of the old school players that enjoyed the old diablos and noticing how much this game is shamelessly overrated i will vote this very low The way Blizzard clearly abandoned the Pc version of the game just focusing on releasing it for console to suck out more money instead of actually EVEN TRYING to improve the PC version Left me even more disappointed If you have a decent PC don t buy this go for something better and FREE like Path of Exile on your pc If you only have a console and you want to try it badly well do it but know that you are buying something surrounded by awfulness Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful See all 51 User Reviews Trailers

bought it for the Xbox 360 Its worth a buy The game fits into the Dishonored sequels well Its a superb DLC for a superb game Game deserves more credit Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful rainbowWaterfal 10 Let s just say though The Knife of Dunwall was great but it was a little disappointing in comparison to the main campaign I feel as though they ve noticed what was not wrong off about TKOD and used what they knew to make a nearly flawless way to end the game This DLC is overall an enjoyable experience that had a lot to offer and kept you on your toes the whole time I was sweating constantly In a fantastic way The DLC is longer than TKOD Depending on your play style and much more challenging due to the Witches that would literally hunt you down like an animal 10 is too low of a price for the amazing expansion 10 10 I say PS3 version reviewed Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful NabaDwA 9 Good addition More of the same from dishonoured but its adds some good quality missions Disappointed that they didn t add more powers but the pull is very interesting to work with Overall a good way to see out one of the best games of 2012 Lets hope for a dishonest 2 on next gen with a deeper storyline Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful SweStars 9 One of the BEST followups I ve ever played I never thought Dishonored one of my favs could be any better Sure This is another approach and the level design is not exactly as good as Corvos story but this alone could have been a standalone game and performs very very well If you really liked Dishonored you HAVE to get this Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful timsim26 9 this dlc is excellent great powers and the environments are really varied and polished once again the high quality dishonored gameplay is present

generation Relentlessly fast paced action with cool relatable characters that will make you laugh cry and cheer Dante our main character is an edgy memorable individual who doesn t care about anyone but himself This makes him an outcast that anyone who s ever had a bit of a loner streak about them will instantly relate to Have you wanted to scream at the world to bleep off Then this is a character for you Virgil is anything brilliantly written character seemingly a cool calm and collected person he later shows a darker side in his pursuit for freedom Much like a roller coaster this ride isn t for children and pregnant women Only mature gamers such as myself should go on this white knuckle adventure through purgatory You would be doing yourself a massive disservice by not buying this game which has some DLC I already can t wait for because of some entitled individuals who can t see the woods for the trees due to their blind rage over something that is different from what they are used to Give this game a chance Expand 32 of 99 users found this helpful TrueGamer1013 10 This is a fantastic game in which I was so pleasantly surprised Yes this is different than the other Devil May Cry games and for one I am glad it is It definitely doesn t ignore the past as many of the overall themes are kept intact The thing to remember is this is a RE BOOT not a remake The series is being taken in a slightly different more edgy direction than the first and I love it Dante is crude he is a bad ass and exactly what Dante should be He s a freaking demon and angel mixed he s no saint I love the art style and direction of the story telling and also LOVE the characters This is a great action title that is well worth your money If you are a DMC fan go into with an open mind that this is again a RE BOOT not a remake and enjoy the game for what Ninja Theory has planned because this is going to be a great new take on an old series that was dying for some life Expand 4 of 16 users found this helpful Venatis 9 The story of DmC which in my opinion isn 4 of 8 users found this helpful TheeLawless 6 Being new to the Devil May Cry universe I found the new addition to the franchise entertaining from a action aspect as well with a kick ass soundtrack written by Noisia and Combichrist With that said I beat it on the hell and hell difficultly and once you have mastered the combo s and upgraded every weapon it s a slight challenge Getting a Sensational ranking is very easy compared to previous Devil May Cry s The game does make you feel like a badass in combat but some fight s are generic and can get a little tedious and annoying I enjoyed the Limbo parts of the game and it shows Ninja Theory had some great artistic designs but the story is were this game starts to suffer To be honest the new look of Dante never steered me away from the game but it was his lack of a interesting character along with Kat and Vergil Bob Barbas the demonic Raptor Reporter was the greatest and most fun boss battle I ve battled in a while at the same time some boss battles are copy and paste and there is not much for innovation The camera angles can sometimes build a mind of it s own and leave you stuck staring at the ceiling but it s a minor issue The final verdict is that it s a okay game after going back through all of the difficulties and getting most of the achievements The DLC Vergil s downfall holds no torch to the actual game If you are a massive fan of the franchise it might disappoint you with only 2 hours of actual gameplay and a somewhat half assed tale of Vergil s Downfall If Ninja Theory made a DMC 2 I d give it a try but the game has gotten a lot of hate but if you want to give this a try wait till a huge price drop and give it ago Don t set your expectations high Plus there is a moment in the game were a white wig happens to flop onto Dante s head and he looks into a mirror reflecting on the old style of Dante Dante smirks and says Not in a million years With this said it s a huge middle finger to the older franchise and like I said myself not being a huge fan of the serious I felt the anger with that being in the game It was unnecessary and it goes to show you where the company feels about the past games and the history of DMC We might not see a DMC 2 and with that I wouldn t be surprised or disappointed Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Kuudou 3 The characterization and writing is terrible The combat from what I have played so far is decent But not quite like the older DMC titles But that s no excuse because combat is something they draw heavily from its predecessors and previous Ninja Theory titles Kinda of hard to screw that up doing something when you have a defined template to work with That being said everything that DMC 5 tries to do to distinguish itself from the previous DMC titles is where it falls apart The way they characterize Dante and Vergil makes them extremely unlikable Kat seems to serve as a plot device more than a character and the story is incoherent and too self serious From what I ve seen in the Official reviews let s say GiantBomb for example it is clear that whoever did that review had not played the previous DMC games Maybe that s fine for those whose first DMC game is this one But fans of the franchise tend to have expectations and higher standards and this particular title does not meet them So all and all I can I can say that this game is designed to rope in a new audience and flip off its old one Expand 28 of 54 users found this helpful Gengar666 1 This review contains

layout from the original 1989 release as a foundation before expanding upon them to significantly enhance the gameplay experience but where this update truly impresses is its graphics and sound All of the visuals from the 8 bit game have been beautifully re created as hand drawn and animated sprites across a backdrop of luscious re envisioned level backgrounds Furthermore original Disney Character

Reviews Write a Review Score distribution Positive 5 out of 6 Mixed 1 out of 6 Negative 0 out of 6 Alhanalem 10 This game does exactly what it aimed to do Recreate a classic game with a more modern look and make it feel a bit like an episode of the TV show It does that well with great remixes of the original music most of the original voice actors from the show making the cutscenes worth watching and an odd but effective art style combining visuals like the TV show with 3Dish elements To those complaining about haivng lives or losing progress All old games were like this This is a remake of an old game Having no lives etc takes away the sense of accomplisment in my opinion If having lives bothers you then you can play on Easy mode which has unlimited lives Only Extreme mode which you have to beat the game on Hard to access has limited lives with no saving progress That s why it s called Extreme You know what you re getting into when you pick that You are warned ahead of time that this will be the case The lower and negative reviews on this game are mostly excessive nitpicking I enjoyed the game the whole way through and the gallery with animation cells from the TV show and all the original music was a nice reward for the effort To those who gave this a 5 50 or below do you have any fun playing any video games People are expecting a remake of a classic to be more than what it s being billed as I guess that s what set them up for disappointment The problem is it wasn t trying to be anything other than it said it was going to be If you like classic side scrolling action than this is definitely a game worth playing Not real long but a decent challenge level and simply fun to play Having lives and risk of failiure just makes it more satisfying when you win Expand 2 of 3 users found this helpful Turrican 10 Great Controls vivid sharp Graphics and hands down one of the best remastered Soundtracks ive heard in a long time especially the Transylvania one for someone who still enjoys Part 1 2 on GB and NES this Version did match all expectanions even the Storyline was a nice Plus So 10 out of 10 for DuckTales Remastered Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful MightyQuinn21 8 Have to say never playing the original NES game this game is pretty damn good It is a bit on the short side but just for 15 dollars it s worth every penny The game is quite difficult as well even on medium but it supposed to be because it plays like an old school So if you want a cheap game that packs ton of nostalgia having the original DuckTales voice actors from the show in the game then it s worth paying for and playing Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful conserd 8 While Remasterd does a fantastic job of remastering the original it doesn t quite hit the mark to be among the generations best platformers it still has some but fine ideas and mechanics Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Asmodeus 7 The problem of this remaster is that while the level design is still top notch some of the other game play design were not updated The whole concept of lives and if you lose all lives you lose everything is literally outdated I ve always been against the concept of losing all progress and this game just does that unfortunately What was once the standard in platforming games back then was never a good one to begin with Way Forward should have made the game more forgiving and allow some sort of check points and keep the diamonds you ve accumulated until you lose all your lives The game encourages you to meticulously search the stages for treasures but punishes you with cheap one hit kills that can ruin your harvest Any developers should reward you for playing their games not frustrate you by making the time you ve played obsolete Initially I was going to give this game an 8 5 but the ending sequence ruined the game for me Aside from the fiasco that is the final stage and the points mentioned above the game has been remastered to perfection Too bad Way Forward took some weird liberties with the final stage Their efforts should have been spent elsewhere Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful 80skid 5 The updated graphics and dedicated button for pogo cane aren t enough to cover up the fact that this game is boring Ducktales should have either stuck to its retro roots like mega 9 or conjured up something fresh and innovative the cutscenes suck They hinder gameplay even though they can be skipped I m a huge ducktales fan and this is a generous pity 5 Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful Trailers DuckTales

rpgs and you like hundreds of hours worth of fun then look no further A game this large is not without its share of minor bugs but these things pale in comparison to the sheer volume of content Not an

5 users found this helpful Rem 9 If Skyrim is not one of the most feature rich games I ve ever played then I haven t played them all Starting out as a prisoner once more I see a trend here you go about Skyrim which is achingly beautiful It is beautiful and that put many linear games to shame The gameplay is where it stands out spells can finally be dual cast and with a sword in hand You progress through the game at your own pace rather than choosing at the beginning The story here while not enthralling or engaging is truly epic Exploring what this vast world has to offer will consume days if not weeks But in Bethesda s traditions with a game this big come many bugs While not as gut wrenching as Fallout 3 to manages to annoy and break immersion I want to keep playing Skyrim and I just might do that right now Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful delux 0 So I purchased this game after getting bored of Fallout New Vegas 50 hours played I was expecting it to be really good because of the positive reviews and tons of people I know telling me it was good So long story short this is one of the worst RPG s I ve played I totally wasted 60 by purchasing this game By the time I was 8 hours in I was literally bored out of my mind I forced myself to play it though so I didn t feel like I wasted 60 and I was hoping it would get better it didn t after 12 more hours of forced play time I couldn t take it anymore My favorite genre to play is an RPG this didn t feel like an RPG at all Pretty much ZERO equipment upgrades no super cool weapons that do crazy no cool armor exploring got tedious and questing bored me after the first few I completed I literally have nothing good to say about this game and I m not sure what other people see in this game to rate it so high To each his own but I definitely feel like I wasted my money on this Expand 0 of 10 users found this helpful See all 1103 User Reviews Trailers Dragonborn The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Trailer Play Video

the GOTY edition with the DLC to enjoy this game I could see this game being an 8 or 9 without the DLC but with the level cap raised and other missions this is my favorite game of all time Expand 27 of 29 users found this helpful auptyk 10 This game is NOT an FPS When going into you need to realize that Fallout has a long and great history and that its history is Turn Based play This is where VATS comes in They have created a great mix of the old Turn Based style play with the speed of FPS The game has great visuals a large and diverse environment that will always be giving you something to do There is no shortage of side quests to keep you busy and you will probably beat the game without exploring 75 of what the game has to offer I recommend at least getting Brotherhood of Steel DLC as it really opens the game up literally and adds a lot of great features Best to get the GOTY version Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful ShaneB 10 While this game does have a few minor flaws the overall play and concept are rock solid it touches on lots of aspects and there is no single action in the game that is overly painful or monotonous from the combat to even the mini games that run when you attempt skills such as lockpick This game is without a doubt a ten out of ten Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful dubz88 10 Fallout 3 is without a doubt my favourite game of this console generation I have put easily over 100 hours into this game and I ve enjoyed every moment of it Fallout 3 is a game that encourages you to go off the beaten path and is far from a linear experience While there is a clear main story there are multiple ways to get to the end Although the side quests are where Fallout 3 shines There are tons of marked and unmarked side quests that keep you exploring the Capital Wasteland To a degree Fallout 3 can also be a fairly emotional experience as well In spite of the game being obviously fictional I particularly enjoyed exploring the abandoned buildings and subway tunnels and reading up on the game lore and learning what led to the events that created the Fallout world The character creation is fairly detailed you can choose between a male or female character in addition to several facial options You can also customize your character as you progress to fit your play style You can invest in points to increase your melee damage increase your accuracy in VATS or raise your charisma if you prefer to talk yourself out of situations Furthermore with the addition of the Broken Steel add on the ending of the game is removed and you can continue to play and explore the world There are also four other DLCs that contribute to the length of the game while giving you access to new perks items and weapons I occasionally ran into the odd technical glitch that ranged from a texture pop in to the game outright freezing I would highly recommend anyone who plays Fallout 3 to save often to avoid the latter occurring during their game and losing their progress Overall Fallout 3 is truly a must have for any gamer who enjoys open world games and in spite of technical problems I experienced I have to give it a 10 out of 10 based on sheer amount of content that is packed into this game Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful JoeMtW 9 A really fun game and I can t really think of too much I don t like about it I played New Vegas before I played this one and I really enjoy this too The story is really awesome and I think the game is pretty creative and original A must buy if you like RPGs Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Scion1337 8 Although it is a rather fun game with the V A T S for the shooter impaired like me I found myself repeatedly thinking of Oblivion and the ilk It may as well be titled Apocalypse The Elder Scrolls for its huge similarity Just like every other Bethesda game I ve played you really need to keep at least 3 saves in case of some weird glitches Combat save level entry save town save but if you can get past that it is a truly enjoyable experience The cinematic cam for when you make an incredible shot like sniping a Raider from half mile away just feels so satisfying until all the other raiders come after you and you can t do anything since your stuck in the kill cam mode That combat save is rather important The game is solid enough to support your play style I even made a second character just to try a more frontal approach instead of the stealth I usually do Thief and Dishonored style gaming will always be in my first approach The levels are well designed enough although cover is sort of scarce for a shooter Although there is plenty of things to pick up not much of it is really worth attention Tin Cans abound but you can t do anything with them for example One thing that I really didn t like at first was the weapon and apparel durability It makes sense but it wasn t something in a game I really wanted Later I found that it made me use different and new weapons during different parts of the plot Like how Raiders use plenty of assault rifles and hunting rifles to repair yours with but you might want to use energy weapons against The Enclave since that s what they use Healing items are rather plentiful and you ll find you don t really need them all once you get a good handle on how the game plays but get them all anyway Your going to need them in the DLCs just to stay alive most of the time Which pretty much sums the game up its all about thinking about trying to survive the wasteland between the part scavenging hostile inhabitants and radiation Planning your next step is always a forethought throughout the game Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful MikeRobichau 0 What game are you guys playing This game is horrible Its slow and targeting

that make the staple of virtual farming while incorporating many new machines vehicles crops animals and environments Farming Simulator 2013 features equipment from the top 20 vehicle manufacturers

Software Genre s Simulations Cheats On GameFAQs More Details and Credits Critic Reviews Score distribution Positive 0 out of 8 Mixed 1 out of 8 Negative 7 out of 8 Gamer nlSep 10 2013 50 Farming Simulator 2013 is made from the perspective of a vehicle simulator through the spectacles of a carpenter for the many agricultural machines Although the farming simulation and economical parts have been well developed it misses the controversial essential elements that made the PC version so interesting The challenge that we praised in that edition doesn t live up to expectations which makes the most expensive version of the game the most limited as well All this publication s reviews Read full review Xbox360AchievementsSep 10 2013 40 Don t be fooled by the funny YouTube vids Farming Simulator 2013 is less fun than mad cow disease All this publication s reviews Read full review Digital SpySep 12 2013 40 Farming Simulator 2013 is unintentionally entertaining at times providing retrospective moments of amusement with its dodgy physics and tedious activities But while it may capture the long gruelling process of maintaining a farm it doesn t do enough to maintain your attention All this publication s reviews Read full review EurogamerSep 12 2013 30 All it had to do was actually simulate farming That apparently is too much to ask from a game called Farming Simulator In its own weird way the complete lack of ambition shown by this underdog has disappointed me more than any lacklustre blockbuster ever will All this publication s reviews Read full review games TM Oct 2 2013 30 Overall Farming Simulator does not feel like a simulator if the point of the game is to offer a realistic experience of what it s like to run a farm the game fails people never fatigue your staff will work straight through the 24 clock if left unattended livestock produce is harvested by AI automatically and there s a few game breaking exploits that completely undermine the game All

Save yourself some money and please do not support this terrible game The game modes are ridiculously boring the game will fail you without reason and the graphics are hideous and out dated For the price this is definitely not worth it maybe 10 on xbox arcade is justifiable The only reason I am giving the game a 3 is that I love the idea of a coop campaign although my partner and I could not enjoy it Expand 11 of 14 users found this helpful Nlwt 1 Very disappointed with this game I never expected it to be brilliant but it is a lot worse than what I thought it would be The selection of cars are poor and driving them are just as bad and the shooting is just terrible Same could be said about the gameplay and the graphics are woeful and it looks like it was released on the old Xbox or something The only way I would have been satisfied playing this is if I bought it for 99p and found it on a charity shop shelf Significantly overpriced and the fact that the game fails you when you do everything right just makes it frustrating Very very poor Expand 4 of 6 users found this helpful gcaraglia 0 Tell me that s a joke Tell me that s a joke Tell me that it s just a nightmare I do not

like I did hopefully you would have kept your excpectations low because this is really only mad for the updated squads and the pretty sweet ultimate team Expand 3 of 9 users found this helpful andy90 wfc 9 The people moaning about this game need to put some serious hours into the game and learn how to play it properly FIFA 14 is definitely a better game than FIFA 13 No longer can you just spam the through ball button and score cheap goals on the counter attack No longer can you sign the quickest players in Ultimate Team and expect to win by just pace abusing It requires more thought than just holding the RT button and that can only be a positive You have to shield the ball with LT learn how to pass and move and be patient if you can t go forwards I can t really fault the actual gameplay of this game The only negative for me is the over reliance on headed goals I never really conceded from corners in FIFA 13 but I m doing it regularly in FIFA 14 Not a major problem but you don t want too many goals being scored from set pieces or crosses from wide areas The presentation is very good as you would expect from an EA sports game The menus have been overhauled and look nicer and are a lot easier to navigate The engine is starting to show its age but i m hoping the Xbox One version updates the graphics and makes it look a bit sharper The crowd need some work too Overall it s a very good game and certainly an upgrade on FIFA 13 Just don t buy this game expecting a major overhaul It is different and different in a good way but the game plays quite similar once you ve got used to it People just don t like how they can t pace abuse anymore Put some serious hours into it learn the new mechanics and you will agree that it s a better game than its predecessor But there s no doubt that everyone is expecting bigger and better things from the Xbox One version The graphics need to be better and the Ignite engine needs to really deliver 9 10 Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful

game a good review I liked the idea of the game being more thoughtful and stopping the speed spamming that used to go on But what they didn t realise is that they made the game an unplayable mess Totally unenjoyable experience and completely scripted Only on fifa can you have 20 shots on target hit the bar 7 times 70 percent possession but you magically lose at the end to a 50 yard long shot It s so frustrating and a waste of time The new scouting system on Fifa is also completely horrid If you want simulation go and play football manager I honestly can t sign hardly any players Worst fifa I ve ever played Expand 1 of 3 users found this helpful gilles27 0 well this game isn t too bad gameplay is a bit better than last year skills are worst season mode is good the same as last fifa

out of 95 Mixed 8 out of 95 Negative 11 out of 95 Jobadkins 10 Lets start this by saying that I have played EVERY racing game ever made since 1973 Simulation or not Pole position to Gran Turismo to burnout to Forza 3 and nothing and I mean nothing is even close to this game that has ever been made The only games that even compare to this game is Forza 1 2 This game has it all and it s so deep and perfect in its quality that you will be popping this in 10 years from now to play to compare and just to remind yourself how much this game is so good and how much ahead of there time they are Over 400 cars and great selection of cars Gran Turismo 4 has over 700 cars but it s not about how many or this or that it s about the guality and how you bring it all together and Forza 3 does that perfectly Mark my words when Gran Turismo 5 comes out in November of 2010 it will have NOTHING on Forza 3 They think because they will have over 1 000 cars and better graphics that they are gonna have a better game well they don t have the first idea of how to make a driving game come together like forza 3 Remember people Forza started just 5 years ago in 2005 and look were there at today just 5 years later If one game ever deserves a perfect 10 it s this game Expand 14 of 17 users found this helpful sinproducer 10 This game is still a very sizable upgrade from the previous title but I also feel like it lost a little bit from Forza 2 The achievements are very linear and don t appeal very much to the completest nature of the second game in the series I was looking forward to having absurd tasks like collecting every car and completing every time trial but this game was built around the hand holding I win button crowd You play the game and hit buttons and you will get free gamerscore as long as you stick through the games linear plot It lays out races before you and you can choose your own path but if you aren t chosing the races they decide are involved in your season then you are not advancing through the game Upgrading can be robotic as clicking a button and letting the CPU feed you a list of parts that would be helpful for your next race If you do mess up in a race you can hit a button and rewind to where you messed up and start over While this is super great on a very long endurance race where your batteries die someone gets in front the TV etc it just sums up the whole feeling this game has towards itself Its very accessable While I disagree with a lot of these choices the fact is this is how you design video games in 2010 and beyond Anyone could have fun in this game as long as they have an intrest in cars or racing in general For the hardcore enthusiast there is plenty to achieve with 100 s of leaderboards drift races and a huge amount of DLC content that comes with the Ultimate edition This game is designed to suck up 100 s of hours of your life and I for one will let it I would really like see some of those super completist achievements and the ability to lock out the rewind function totally by difficulty settings in Forza 4 This doesn t make sense when the game rewards you for setting everything to simulation settings and brutally hard AI for a better rewards yet you still have the ability to rewind the game at any time Of course its optional to use but it simply shouldn t be there at all at the hardest level of playing This is something they stole from Grid but didn t quite understand what to do with it ie limit it Still this is the best time consuming race game out there for me and with the Ultimate edition dirt cheap its a no brainer to own it if you don t and even remotely love racing games Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Japster 10 Forza Motorsport 3 is by far the greatest driving simulator of all time it surpasses Polyphony s Gran Turismo 5 in every aspect this is considering Forza 3 is two years old This is a highly polished title in terms of visuals sound and playability To add to the realism the game runs at a buttery smooth 60 frames per second With it s adjustable difficulty Forza Motorsport 3 is a must have title for casual and hardcore gamers alike and with a lengthy career along with a robust multiplayer Forza 3 will keep you behind the drivers seat for months to come or until Forza 4 hits the shelves Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful Matsuda 9 Nice cars all around seems like they really took their time with all 400 or so cars in the game Would have liked more but i guess this is more about quality over quantity The problem i have with it though is the extra cars that are coming in as downloads They re nice additions who wouldn t want to try out the new 458 italia beautiful cars but I don t think i should pay for all those downloads seems like a excuse to make more money off the game But this doesn t change the face that the game is well made and well paced I just wish i didn t have to pay extra for the cars i want turning a 60 dollar game to a 100 dollar game Microsoft oh you sometimes Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful WiliamJ 9 Forza 3 is a very polished and accoplished game Its an upgrade of forza 2 It has some loading and pop in problems so minor but still catches the eye Multiplayer component has been smoothed out less lag and stuff Make sure you have gold membership This isn t a 10 game because of the bugs and pop in Expand 1 of 2 users found this helpful SimonR 8 I really think that to change the time shouldnt be in a Racing sim and if than it should be limited So you can use it just ONCE in a Race and not infinite Another Reason is because its lacking of Weather Effects Its not standard but its something what would be cool Its a little to Arcady in my eyes I know a lot of people like that but I dont Amazing is the Tireflex The Graphic is above standard but not overwhelming and the Sorrounding feels kind of empty Physics are good but I expected more its not a 100 Hardcore Sim you dont have to use the features which make the game easier but I dont like compromises Online Features are wonderfull its a really really good racing sim but I am not as overwhelmed as I wanted to be Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful

grunted testosterone soaked dialogue sloppily plaster over the campaign s heavy handed morality play While the plot makes sense this time around its clumsy mysteries are old hat to anyone moderately

KieranM 10 After playing through and completing the campaign I am absolutely stunned The games looks beautiful and play beautifully too The story offered more than thought and blew me away Some bugs are still appearing but that doesn t hinder the fact that it is one of the bext games out on Xbox 360 Multiplayer is enhanced although needs ironing out in places Stupid amounts of fun can be had with mates and Horde is another stunning co op inventive feature A superb game any fans of shooters good MP games or gore should get this Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful SeanMcB 10 I like that you can be revived if you are downed but it gets pretty challenging in co op mode since you need both knowledge and skill to complete this game on legendary mode I really think that they took a lot of time on this game and really did a good job with Improving some mistakes from Gears of war 1 Good job guys Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful LaserHairs 10 I would have given this game a 9 5 if I could I felt that Epic Games had succeded in yet another awesome game The new horde mode is a great laugh The online progression system is sweet and the maps are epic Especially now they ave released the All Fronts Collection what an awesome deal The online is deffinatlet better than the original But the campaign however seemed to lack the feel of gears of war 1 I miss the Kryl and Beserkers I didn t feel scared in any way and the storyline just didn t seem quite as good as the previous and I still can t get my head around the fact that the lightmass bomb made the locust stronger However that said the campaign did feel more epic with the large armies and the updated technology meaning you can fit loads of enemeies on the screen Skorge was definitely a better bad guy than RAAM and I was glad to see more of the lambant locust except this time not just wretches Overall I d say Gears of War 2 is a must have it s an oustanding game both offline and online but the storyline just wasn t quite good enough for me Expand 5 of 6 users found this helpful AdamW 8 Not the best game ever but still one of the best cover shooters around The storyline was a little disappointing with the extremely easy end boss but the inclusion of 5 of the original Gears of War maps makes up for that Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful LennyB 7 for all those who gaves this a ten you are obviously blind or just hitting puberty grant the game was good no where near awesomeness grant it if that is even a word besides that the graphics are decent but the repetitive chainsaw scenes get old after a while on that note if you see your body about to get sliced you should be able to shoot the blade away and how the scene happens its like no effort there should be more effort behind trying the cut someone like if you come up behind someone they automatically turn around and except there fake needs more fight horde mode was a valuable asset but got repetive quick the boss battles were in my eyes terrible where was the strategy where was the effort i saw none i know its a game but like how does it happen that if you get should so many times in the head you don t die they call it a headSHOT for a reason not headshots thats always been a pet peeve for me in this game at least in halo they had helmets in this they had nothing except for carmine a cool and worthwhile asset to have in gears is the ability to customize at least your armor or face and on the guns a little kinda boring play as the single player characters all and all this game deserves a 7 Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful ChrisK 5 I played GoW1 to death and filled my time waiting for GoW2 by playing CoD4 great game BTW I really enjoyed GoW2 campaign mode and co op I also like the Horde mode but when it comes to online multi player I can not even express my dissapointment in words Set aside the long drawn out process of trying to find a match or the lack of being able to stay in a room and play more than one match against an opposing team The shotgun what the hell happened It used to be the noobs would try and chainsaw you but a decent player with a shotgun would would see them fall Now the game is catering to the Lancer and chain saw The delay between shotgun blasts allows an opponent too much time to close the distance and chainsaw you I also can t believe you can t fire the shotty while running I tend to buy a game andplay nothing but that game for several months or even a year before finding a different game that is just as good I played the first GoW for over a year before I got tired of it and moved on Gow2 is already on the back burner after 3 weeks I will probably play it again if the multiplayer issues are fixed Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful LazarusS 0 A very terrible game I regret to inform you curious metacritic browsing person I did not care much for the game at all I would rate it a zero out of ten because I could not stand the game long enough to

this game with my friend we play versues my friend likes to use the chain saw gun I look at his face all the time when he usues the chain saw he smiles laughs and screams happy scream anyways my friend is nuts about thee chain saw soooo have it in the next one it makes him happy Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Zilcell 10 I haven t played this game in a long time but I really enjoyed it Shooting combat has rarely been as unique as Gears of War and this game was only the beginning of a great series Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful ArkonBlade 10 for a game thats loaded to the hilt with bugs and glitches its one of the most funest games ive played both online and off the story mode is only about 5 6 hours long but its a fun 6 hours with some of the best voice acting and diolouge in any game to date it has a good cover mechanic and with 2 player co op its a blast not to mention you get a chainsaw on the end of your gun the animayions of cutting your enimy into little bits of meat just never gets old the online is the real mear of this game never in a online game is team work so vital to victory the fun ive had with my friends on this was just intense the formulation of stratagy planning are next move just seperates this from all the other ho hum cockie cutter shooters out there the game isnt flawless the story in this game is badley told you are basically in the middle of a story and get no clear sense of how it all started there are alot of bugs and glitches in this game and even after almost 4 years they still havent fixed 75 of them and they have done like a 100 patches for this game still this looks and feels original despite the flaws im still giving it a 10 because there are a million run and gun call of duty clones out there but only 1 gears of war and it rains king over every thing els that is a online shooter Expand 3 of 5 users found this helpful InzaNe 9 Quite possibly the best shooter I have played on the Xbox360 While some people automatically rule Gears of War out because it is an over the shoulder or Third Person shooter players need to give it a chance and allow themselves to fall into the gameplay The multiplayer delivered past tense as it s fairly inactive now when it was active If you can find this game for 20 or less I would say pick it up and play it as Gears of War 2 was great and Gears of War 3 is on it s way Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful LarsB 8 A graphical wonderful game with a good atmosphere not so good in storytelling but deep in experience and very brutal at least there are a lot of better games on the xbox360 also in graphics but this is definitely one of the better ones Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful Mr Gunther 7 I feel this game is greatly overrated Sure it shines at times mainly during the co op campaign which itself is one of the best out there yet far too short Single player is dull and lifeless however and online play gets very boring very quickly using the same duck and cover game mechanic over and over again gets old fast An intense and gripping 3rd person shooter then that suffers from a bland very grey colour scheme a campaign that is far too short repetitive gameplay and a very hardcore noob hating online community Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful andrewjohnson 0 frist off im not a big first shooter fan anyway but wanted to try this game becuase it was hyped and theres not many good games for the 360 yet the game has great graffics but it still dosent challenge the player in new and fun ways just mindless shooting and

ranting about how great this game is I just wish that every person who loves the mindless violence of the others would stop posing those horrendous 0 s This game is definetly a classic experience If the difficulty is too hard you shouldn t be playing video games What I loved about this game the most was the differing situations every time If I failed a mission I strategized and looked for say an alleyway which I could sneak into if the combat got too intense A different experience every time makes this game one of the most original of all time Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful TheChiefOfCOD 10 Wow I really loved this game It in every way blew me away A captivating epic and deep storyline keeps you into it the entire way through Me trying to find at least one thing to complain about Nothing This game really deserves GOTY And I really have to say Niko Bellic is the only character in the GTA series that you can truly connect with Understanding his difficult life and mis adventures you can really feel his emotions And for a free roaming game they really knocked me out The free roaming really is amazing Its awesome how they can have such a nice luminous city and still have amazing and almost flawless graphics As for the multi player I didn t really play it that much but i love the fact that you can roam around Liberty City causing as much mayhem as you want The ranked matches are good too with death match etc it was pretty cool to see that in a GTA game Surely I can truly say that you have not experienced free roam sandbox games until you have played GTA IV Expand 21 of 32 users found this helpful JamesM 9 One of the best games ever story is great and you get to make choices that can change the direction the story goes in Multiplayer is good too a great laugh with mates The only reason to not give it a 10 is the pop ups I knew the game would have random pop ups due to the speed you can tear around a gigantic city that is so very detailed A must own for all gaming fans Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful BillA 8 Its a shame to see hype play the deciding factor in a games overall score Many of these review websites are owned and operated based on profit If a game is advertised well it receives near perfect scores Not very truthful GTA does deliver as promised however the gameplay and complexity is almost a step down from GTA SA No game can match the size and quality shown in GTA therefore it does deserve a good score But foes it deserve a perfect score in my opinion not yet Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful SteveK 7 this whole review debacle is a classic case of game magazines and reviewers getting doped up on the hype and extreme expectations that surrounds some games in the run up to the release gta4 certainly is a good game but very far from perfection even far from being excellent it s very enjoyable sometimes and sometimes outright dull why countless reviewers have overlooked the glaring flaws is beyond me a review score shouldn t rate effort and ambition gameplay is king and in regard to that gta4 is certainly above average but falls short of greatness a healthy 7 points I say Expand 0 of 0 users found

reviews this game packs so much into one game What really makes this game stand apart is in the details Los Santos really feels like downtown LA There is the constant hum from the highway and even sounds of someone racing down the highway much like here in AZ and I live next to the freeway Going to the beach and hearing the waves lapping on the rocks looks and sounds like the real thing i ve been to the beach Walking down the street you can eavesdrop on conversations in one instance this girl was talking about getting breast reduction surgery making it entertaining to just walk beside her

encourages you to develop heist characters for a total of 2 more heists There are no further heists you can organise on your own after you finish the game in fact aside from buying property there is very little to do once you complete the game As you don t make much money until the last 15 of the game you are left with a game that forces you to complete the story as fast as possible so you can have some money to modify cars and such The game sadly feels incomplete The most telling sign of incompleteness is GTA Online This is perhaps the worst ever online release I have ever seen It should really have been ready with the game but this isn t the issue Having waited for online to be released it took me 3 days to get online Once I was finally online there were issues loading missions and with matchmaking You lose a lot of money when you die to encourage you to use your real money to buy in game money which just ruins the gameplay This micro transaction mechanism works with free to play games but when I have already spend 45 on the game I don t expect to be encouraged to spend more The most irritating the about GTA Online is that my character after hours of gameplay has completely disappeared In a response Rockstar comment on some of the minor bugs such as missing cars or guns instead of the really big issue of missing characters Poor release and poor support since I

and more strait hours of gameplay and I m tearing through easy then medium and hard This is absolutely the most addicting game I ve ever played Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful Hello 10 THe best game by far for xbox 360 except maybe oblivion but this is a completely different game IT is the most addicting game on the shelves and offers hours of gameplay I highly recommend this game to anyone of all ages wheter you like video games or not it offers an oppurtunity to people who have never touched a guitar in their entire life to rock on I play guitar myself and i must admit that this will not help you play the guitar except that it may improve your rhythm Buy this game IT ROCKS Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful MarkT 10 Put simply it s the funnest game available for XBOX 360 0 of

addictive and just fun to watch My dad even plays this game and he doesn t play videogames 0 of 0 users found this helpful Kenmei 9 This was the game that got me really into the Music game scene and was definitely the best version of the series before GH 3 started to try to appeal to all music genres instead of just the rock genre it was known for I played this game for hours upon hours and neither Rock Band nor the subsequent GH games could compare to this one for me If this game had the online support the later versions had it probably would have been alot better However the lack of focus on one genre really hurt the later versions of the game as well as the lack of creativity towards the end But if your a rock fan and just felt like the later versions of this game and Rock Band failed to deliver enough of the songs you really liked then pick this game up There are some excellent songs in this version and you don t have to wade through some of the crap from the later versions Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful ChrisR 0 I dunno why the hell people like this game for my taste this game is as metal as DDR this game has no metal cred whatso ever No self Respecting metal head would really want to waste their time with a game as commercial and just plain lame if you really like Rock just go out to a local music store and buy yourself a real guitar and butcher the music

still shines This game is enjoyable to the point that the only contention comes not from game flaws but from personal preference or perhaps the undeniable draw to be a dissident Think the campaign too short Have you Beaten it on solo legendary yet How about multiplayer Halo 3 is sure to be an icon of online gaming for years to come This game has incredible replay value and ultimately the number one reason I m giving it a 10 is this it is FUN Remember even if you happened to like the pistol as a superweapon or don t enjoy non mouse FPS games individual preference does not make this game any less than what it is But there is one thing where is our Blood Gulch Bungie Where is the love Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful PinkFloyd 10 Certainly this game suffers from a user base that looks at its immense popularity among non gamers and shudders I gave this game a ten because not only do I enjoy this game multiplayer especially personally but because people who aren t into video games are still into Halo 3 Even people who claim that you have to be into the franchise to be into Halo 3 are wrong when you look at the sheer numbers Did one million people log on to Halo 2 every day Absolutely not but Halo 3 logs just under that number of users almost an entire year after its release and anyone who actually plays will tell you that it s not a population of fanboys because it really isn t I highly recommend this game especially for science fiction FPS lovers like myself who want a game with a story that provides more depth and symbolism than CoD4 or Gears could ever hope to offer and a multiplayer that kicks just as much ass Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful TylerI 10 As some of you may give this a 0 how can you guive it that The balance is soo well done online

Halo 2 I loved this one Thr levels Tsvaso s Highway to the level Halo is just pure fun on Legendary But the multiplayer is where the entire community is You could probably play this game in 2016 and there probably will be at least 500 people on But now 2 5 years after it 9 25 07 release there are 75 000 to 200 000 people on depending on the time Just purely one of the best games on the Xbox 360

more on the way in DLC interesting multi tiered and interactive environments and great easter eggs and fan service to hardcore comic fans like myself The controls and combo timing is great for both hardcore fighters and more casual ones as it took my friends very little time to catch up to a skill level where I didn t feel like I was being an oppressive combo master just because I played the game before they did Definitely worth the money and though the campaign is short there is a tremendous amount of fun stuff to do with the challenge tower and S T A R Labs features Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful ludd gang 10 I am a casual fighter gamer and picky about games The tutorial has been very helpful Graphics are fantastic controls are great Although I never could get the hang of several fighting games including Mortal Kombat Injustice collects the best aspects of the genre and definitely aims for a wide audience One minor nit I wish the tutorial would demo the moves so you d know what it looked like when correctly executed ala Soul Calibur Expand 9 of 10 users found this helpful apeman360 9 awesome game love the fighting mechanics the screen transition are pretty good and it just isnt a reskin of mortal kombat far from it reccomend it to all fighting game lovers Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful TheWonderwall 9 An fighting game about DC Comics with the style from Mortal Kombat That s so freaking awesome This game is great in very ways they build the characters all different from each other the interaction with the scenario is far great guys I can t stop playing this game the multiplayer for our surprises IT S GREAT TOO just like the S T A R S Labs Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful BlackwingBoss 8 Injustice is one of those games you can just jump into It s basic control scheme makes it easy for new players who aren t the biggest fans of fighting games jump straight into it and start doing work The tutorial is a nice helper for someone coming into it and it explains it s new system of transitions and interactions quite nicely The character roster is a bit lack luster whith a measy 24 characters with planned DLC And the multiplayer has been improved from MK9 but don t expect an experience like a local 1 1 match The character s moves are really diverce and can come together to form a really high combo and deal large amounts of damage One thing I don t like is that every character only has 1 intro outro and super move Seeing the super moves the first time is pretty neat lbut once you ve seen it a few times It gets quite boring Another thing I really like about this game is the health system and the wager system The new wager system makes me think twice before using a super move before a wager has happened The health system is unique in that once you hit past your first bar of health you can t get that back from any wager you ve won and your damage doesn t bleed into the next bar It really makes you wait to use super moves or really long combos Eventually whenever both players are down to the second bar of health you can enter a mode called a Wager this is where you can wager you re power that you ve collected to gain HP or deal damage The winner is decided by who wages the most that may not be right but from what I ve seen through my days of playing my theory has been correct Like Mortle Kombat Nether Realm has made the story mode really compelling and intresting Making you play as characters as you go through the story lets you learn the character a little more in depth before battling against a friend or in multiplayer I won t spoil anything about the singelplayer story but it takes an intresting spin on Superman In short I can say I would recomend Injustice to friends but the issues with the multuiplyer and the non diverce supers and intros outros really slow down the game for me I will give an 8 10 above avergae but not perfect Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Gradaluski 8 If you are looking for a fun fighting style game that you can not only play with a good friend but you can play with your younger cousin this game is a great pick Not only did this game feel like the Classic Mortal Kombat but it was lowered down to a T rating so that younger kids could enjoy it Now I know to older kids the loss of blood and gore in a Mortal Kombat style game can be disappointing but taking that away was a genius business venture that is making the game sell far more copies by expanding the market so can you really blame them That is just my personal opinion however To a seasoned super hero fan it was nice to have a game in which they feature a lot of the awesome DC Characters and Aqua Man FINALLY DIDN T SUCK Anyone who knows anything about DC can appreciate that fact The game had an OK plot but I really don t think this game is to be purchased for the plot This game is one of those games where you may play the campaign in order to get better at it but you really only own it as a game to play whenever friends come over Have no friends That s Okay The plot may not be that great but if you really don t know much about DC the plot is still good enough to keep your attention and even if you ignore it you can draw a face on a pillow Set that pillow on the sofa next to you buy a second controller to give to the pillow and force yourself to believe that the character you are fighting is your new best friend you have over Pillow Now if this method gives you long term mental issues I deeply apologize I just wanted you to have a friend Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Foam 4 Injustice Gods Among us comes very close to being a flawless fighting game in the DC universe but falls short for one reason Lack of 2vs2 tag modes in both local online play One of the major factors about fighting games is multiplayer a fact seemingly forgotten by Netherrealm Studios since releasing the widely successful Mortal Kombat reboot Mortal Kombat returned to it s 2d fighting game roots in full 3d gory pleasure Tones of extra features unlockable characters unlockable moves an fatalities provided immense replayability In Mortal Kombat 9 Player 1 could form a tag team with Player 2 and play other 2 man tag groups online over Xbox live This provided simple yet crucial enjoyment to people with friends which is just about everyone Locally 4 players could go head to head in a 2 vs 2 tag match resulting in many fun nights with my group of friends I Then Injustice comes along builds upon the MK9 model in many ways but leaves this crucial feature out You may not think this a big deal but it is huge considering these games are meant to be played against other people competitively No one buys a fighting game to fight against AI longer than he has to to complete the main campaign Netherrealm Studios however thinks otherwise It is unknown to me why this feature has been removed Perhaps it was to force groups of friends to all buy their own copy of Injustice Overall the game is very smooth Anyone who says the game is for casuals isn t too bright In fact casuals will be destroyed Various improvements over cheapness in MK9 has been implemented such as changes to blocking fairy jumping Jumping straight up and punching sending the enemy downward bouncing up in preparation for your combo and others The characters are interesting and the mechanics enhanced over MK9 The special attacks are very great It s very rewarding to watch Lex Luthor call down a satellite superstrike on your target and you grabbing that energy and chucking it at your opponent Each character is truly unique My friend and tried them all out and not one was similar in any way Conclusion For months my frirends I have been looking forward to taking the MK9 formula and enhancing it They have definitely done that but the lack of 2vs2 tag modes for local online play seriously negate any enhancements After all what does it matter how great it is when we can t even play Co op VS eachother at once or test our skills together against online opponents Expand 0 of 16 users found this helpful See all 93 User Reviews Trailers Injustice Gods Among Us Zatanna Character

understand play and enjoy on a constant basis because it has done this in a manner that should prove utterly essential to veterans and newcomers alike and more than enough to suggest Mass Effect 3 will be the most important game in BioWare s history All this publication s reviews Read full review GameSpy 100 It s the way that Mass Effect 2 expands upon the narrative established in the first game that marks a true breakthrough for interactive storytelling All this publication s reviews Read full review Telegraph 100 The only thing that shocked us more was the fact that we instantly wanted to play it again from the beginning With Mass Effect 2 BioWare have created an astonishing video game which is likely to entrance casual and hard core players alike The only requirement one needs to

2 is a title that everyone has to experience As fun as the first title was it did have its own share of issues It s refreshing to see a development team take in all of the criticism from their

video games I have ever played This game has set a precedent that all future releases will have a burden of measuring up to Buy now Play forever Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Plumbum 10 Well every game has it s detractors but seriously Oh noes they dun stole my RPG elements It is awl dumb down and stoopid now blissfully forgetting through their misty eyed watercolour memories that Mass Effect could be muscled through with sheer gaming skill and an unleveled Shepard Being able to be beaten by skill alone an RPG does not make The inventory was awful it turned the whole game into a puzzle of managing your inventory I m glad to see it gone To finish up the romance options are much improved instead of humans only or a 106 year old archeologist Expand 15 of 28 users found this helpful Chris 10 I ve seen people rating it low for running too slow but you can actually sprint in the game lolwut Yeah lrn2play people Also the first ME1 wasn t nearly as great as ME2 ME1 was lagging if you were to fight more than one person you d lag everywhere the DLCs in ME1 showed that The Mako in ME1 was annoying and if people are saying ME1 is better they don t know anything If you don t like the shooter type of gamestyle for those RPG fans become an adept use your powers to throw people slam or knock people over People also complaining about audio level Lol learn to press start and go to options and make the music lower And it s thermal clips so the gun can reload faster when it overheats In ME1 when it overheated it took forever to get it back to normal Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful CaseyP 10 I bought Mass Effect 1 along with my xbox and Halo 3 at the end of 2008 It almost took me a year to but the disk in my machine but when I did I was pleasantly surprised I played through and beat it three separate times I was lucky I only ended up waiting 6 or 7 months after completing Mass Effect 1 for Mass Effect 2 however it would have been worth a three year wait Simply put Mass Effect 2 is the best game on xbox 360 I don t see where any criticism can come from other then the slow paced planet scanning who s only crime is taking to long to execute even with the advanced scanning upgrade Characters are perfect Classes are more unique then the first one and combat is fantastic and fun Above all the story is better then 99 of the sci fi genre as a whole movies books comics games ect All these elements along with a streamlined RPG style that puts wait on choices you have a game that is both personal and epic BioWare is among the top game developers and along with Valve they always make games that are within the 90th percentile of gaming This game is the perfect 100 on there stellar roster Expand 1 of 2 users found this helpful R3DRocket 10 An amazing game Not as good as 3 but better then 1 The first game suffered from sub par shooting mechanics The sequel fixes this and makes a game that competes with the best Story is great and acting amazing Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful Jarbas6 9 Gameplay is maybe the worse aspect of Mass Effect 2 and sometimes it feels like a weird Gears of War but this game goes deeper than most of games I ve played The RPG elements are simple and intelligent Choices system is something different that you don t see in every game but in Mass Effect 2 it is complex and amazing Oh the main missions last about 15 hours but you won t want to do only them because the secondary missions feel like primary ones and how you get into them by exploring planets in a weird eletronic galaxy map is awesome Mass Effect 2 is not perfect but the way it is different from many games out there makes I recommend this to nearly everyone Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Tahooper 0 Loved the first game don t know what happen in this one Feels that they didn t feel good with the game the first time and threw everything away Is a complete different setting instead of the council now it has a corporate sponsor Horrible plots with lots of holes The last one was sci fi this is like gossip girl on space Arrrgh I can t believe I wasted 60 bucks in this Not buying the next one for sure And they can buy all the reviews they want In the end they know who are the real fans Why buying an angry space shooter game if there is Gears Half life even Modern Warfare What was this game offering that the others

out of 52 Nikola8 10 This is by far the best DLC for ME3 and the second best of the franchise first is shadow broker This does so many things right No spoilers but the DLC can be conveniently divided into four distinct areas 1 There is a side story arc that will take 2 5 hours to complete The story is interesting especially since it doesn t involve Reapers Cerberus or Collectors I won t say more in order to avoid spoilers This doesn t just feel like a filler story but is rather thought out Characters from previous games are brought back and many background stories such as the First Contact War are given more context 2 The second component of the DLC is similar to the Hearthfire expansion of Skyrim although not as involved by any means This allows Shepard to obtain and customize an apartment on the Citadel Kind of a fun experience and it allows for Admiral Anderson s background story to be more deeply investigated 3 The third component of the DLC revolves around the fact that it opens an entirely new district in the Citadel for exploration There are many things to do but the most notable are the Casino Video Arcade and Combat Simulator The casino has a variety of games to play to gamble some of your in game credits The video arcade has a handful of simple games to play The combat simulator is one of the best additions in the DLC It resembles the Pinnacle Station DLC in this regard from the first game but is much more customizable it draws heavily from the multiplayer of the game This mode allows you to play with squad members from ME1 and ME2 which is awesome 4 While not a separate component this DLC lets you interact with characters from other games throughout fighting along side them and interacting with them Characters such as Miranda Jack and Thane will allow for additional romance options if you romanced them in ME2 Final thoughts this DLC is amazing The small story doesn t feel wasted The extra district in the Citadel is fun to explore especially the combat simulator The apartment design is probably the least appealing part of this and that is simply because it is so simplistic The interactions with your crew both past and current are very well done Overall the DLC is excellent The writing is also very good and inserts a LOT of humor which is a welcome relief to the sometimes tense mood of the game I would highly recommend it and even though it is the most expensive DLC it is by far worth the 15 asking price Expand 20 of 23 users found this helpful EABanBoy 10 This must have been made post MF3 ending because this is a gigantic step up its what people truly loved about the series it s characters No reapers no Cerberus no foolish gun game play just well written dialogue Expand 1 of 2 users found this helpful dragonbourne1 10 This review contains spoilers click expand to view So Shepard crew are ordered to Citadel for shore leave Once there you get an appartment wont say from who After which your thrust in to a plot in an attempt on Shepards life Eventually the whole crew is involved It turns out Shepard has an evil clone So the story was pretty good I found it in some ways reminisant of old Star Trek s good Kirk bad Kirk The gun play was for the most part adiquite The humor was so poking fun at everyone especially Shepard It did not however detract from the story though After all is said and done you can throw a party as well as mod your new house which you can revisit at any time There are other things to do on this portion of Citadel Casino arcade combat simulator and some mini missions All of which I found to be a nice distraction of the glumness of the main story No glitches or bugs that I saw on my playthrough It also felt like a fond farewell episode of a well loved tv show Very nice but kinda sad I would very much recomend this Its also reasonably priced for the size which is almost 4 gigs Expand 4 of 7 users found this helpful Wolfenstein9598 9 As I have played all of the Mass Effect and loved them I had high hopes for this and I was not disappointed I had a big grin on my face throughout this apart from the beginning where I was an adept and every enemy had shields and I had no way of killing shields The references are great and this is well worth the price of admission Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful kafkaten 9 If you fell in love with these characters like I did since way back in ME1 then you need to get this DLC The combat is ok but just ok It s the story and getting one last chance to roll with Garrus Wrex and the gang Oh and it s funny Actual real laughs and not just by videogame standards Expand 1 of 2 users found this helpful Crichtonrygel 8 While I didn t hate the ending to Mass Effect 3 as much as everyone else I will say this is a more fitting conclusion to the trilogy and best activated as far into the game as possible It s also very meta heavy and the humor completely off sets the tone of Mass Effect 3 s core story and will obviously not be to everyone s taste Citadel s split into two parts a main three part mission which can take 1 2 hours to complete then an epilogue which can feature all the surviving Normandy crew from the first two Mass Effect games Just spending time with these characters again made the 15 price worth it for me and the only down side is I don t really want to go back to the game proper after completing Citadel Expand 6 of 7 users found this helpful PanDaZZiaN 0 this game is good but i don t get the point where to go the game give me too little information for me to continue playing and there should be more

publication s reviews Read full review Official Xbox Magazine UKMar 6 2012 100 Mass Effect 3 is brave enough to threaten to destroy its very own legacy Everything you ve worked for is genuinely at risk and horrifying things are going to happen because of some of the choices you ve made If you ve spent as long as we have with these characters the impact of this final journey will be one you don t forget for years Brave thrilling and incredibly emotional Mass Effect 3 is a sci fi masterpiece All this publication s reviews Read full review Xbox World AustraliaMar 13 2012 98 Mass Effect 3 is a fitting conclusion to the trilogy that manages to put the best parts of Mass Effect 1 with the best parts of Mass Effect 2 Sure it will never be as much an RPG as the title that started it all but as a result the game is actually surprisingly more fun to play and feels like a very well put together third person shooter that is bolstered by an in depth customisation system for both your weapons and your skills All this publication s reviews Read full review Pelit Finland Mar 13 2012 92 Mass Effect 3 is a fitting conclusion to one of the best RPG franchises ever The story is gripping and gameplay wise Bioware has fixed many of the errors they made with the second game most importantly the renegade paragon points work properly again and you are free to actually role play as you see fit It doesn t quite reach the greatness of the first Mass Effect game though Still a great game and a great end to Shepard s story March 2012 All this publication s reviews GamestyleMar 19 2012 90 In conclusion this game has not let the series down Opinion will differ with the actual story but with the amount of different options available in the game that is bound to happen It just can t be stressed enough that this game will only give half the pleasure if it is played without prior Mass Effect experience All this publication s reviews Read full review games TM Mar 6 2012 90 While it s not a total

else is perfect Great graphics sound and game play Expand 0 of 3 users found this helpful McNugget 10 Mass Effect 3 is the best game ive ever played it has a great story good graphics and a excellent soundtrack i was a little disappointed with the ending but other than that the game was amazingly good 10 10 Expand 2 of 4 users found this helpful RogerWilco2099 10 Nothing less then perfection I managed to get a copy a few days early and I never thought the story and game could top what the last two games have delivered but this keeps getting better and better You really do feel the weight of those decisions you made Its great to finally see the outcome of these shaping after waiting for 5 years in curiosity as to what would happen Certainly doesn t disappoint Gameplay mechanics have taken a sharp turn for the better and have progressed a long way since ME2 It great a lot of mods that were a fun point of ME1 have returned also Shepard s story could not have asked for a better conclusion then this Massive credit to Bioware to improving on a series that is already top of its league No easy feat but they have done it with flying colors Expand 118 of 300 users found this helpful tomy90 7 Spoiler free Plus points Gameplay interesting map layouts and combat is even better than ME2 Story Brilliantly happy sad and awe inspiring moments throughout most of ME3 Your Story the game crafts itself around your previous decisions and see many of those decisions play out in front of you Graphics crisp and feels like you are in a real war rather than turf war characters feel alive and can get attached to characters online very much refreshing and good for occasional breaks Negatives Ending no closure logical explanation of ending and plot holes probably worst ending I have ever seen Dialogue extremely well done when scenes appear but much more linear than ME2 experience and less often Galaxy At War makes it impossible to get the best ending without playing online and reduces your decisions to statistics rather than emotional decisions Navigation can be tricky with side missions that are not highlighted on the map where they are which ends up needing using online sources or guides to find out where to go Lack of exploration you can go across the galaxy but only one location you can visit constantly no matter what which is much less than ME1 and ME2 Overall Apart from the ending all the issues in ME3 are minor issues that can be easily forgiven because of the overall experience throughout except for the last section If the ending of the mass effect 3 was satisfactory not perfect but an improvement I would most likely give ME3 9 0 or 10 but because of the ending putting a sour note on the entire series and damages replay value it is 7 0 till DLC or something comes along to remedy the issue Expand 1 of 5 users found this helpful Jirekianu 4 This review contains spoilers click expand to view The endings are all massively disappointing Your options seem to kill almost everyone and the way the mass relays react to the energy surge seems to show them blowing up regardless of the option you pick Shephard dies no matter how well you prepare or what you do The galaxy at war map never changes It s always offline Your readiness never shifts from 50 So yeah thanks Bioware Thanks for building up such a great game and then giving me a rushed and ending All of those complaints said and out of the way I was really happy with the game Enjoying everything that happened for the most part Some of the dialogue was goofy at times and I don t mean in a sappy way I mean it was showing poor writing Whoever approved these endings needs to be fired I would give this game a 9 10 if the endings weren t so terrible and half assed Expand 12 of 21 users found this helpful jimbodean 2 Been a fan since the first article I read about mass effect 7 years ago What a disappointment ME3 has been dumbed down from the great rpg it was I will agree that the combat is tight and smooth but thats not the main reason why I chose to play it even after I started to hear the ugly rumors Had to find out for myself Official reviews sing praise after praise even while the fan base has spoken very loudly of their displeasure I couldn t agree more after playing through myself I don t even want to go into what I thought about the ending I honestly feel ripped off Now I see bioware tap dancing and trying to put a positive spin on a turd while condemning people s criticisms Chalk one up for EA You got my 50 bucks and could care less Expand 3 of 6 users found this helpful discodave91 0 No improvement on Mass Effect 2 Just a re hash of the last game The mission system is terrible You have no idea what stage you are at in the missions or where to go The side quest are again re hashes of the online multi player Some of the aspects of furthering the story are quite good up to a point Then the game has the most stupid uneducated simplistic disappointing ending I have ever seen in a game It takes no account of the lore of the game makes no sense would result in everyone being stranded and most of the systems being destroyed along with everyone that you were trying to save and your choices make no difference to the ending of the game Even though its an A B C ending they are all pretty much identical Bio Ware used to be great but now they seem to have a knack at ruining their games look at Dragon Age 2 EA are probably to blame The whole game was also very buggy At one point I had 2 Edi s Tali died and then came back from the dead in a love seen and doors would randomly take an age to open Sometimes powers and squad commands did not work To sum up the entire game felt rushed was buggy and had a generic ending that made no sense Very

completion at Visual Concepts the devs didn t forget about fine tuning the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions adding exclusive content and a sleeker gameplay Overall NBA 2K14 gained in rhythm the dribbles are easier to manage and the defense system rocks Add to the mix new crazy animations and you ll have a good picture of what NBA 2K is today We can also enjoy the presence of Euroleague even if the 14 available teams not including France are restricted to exhibition matches which brings some fresh air to the roster On the other hand we were let down by Lebron James s mod Path to Greatness badly

everyone else but i play the game for the actual game I havent played my player and the assoication modes yet which i love btw but i can tell you from the actual gameplay this game is amazing The blocks are on point The steals the transition offense and defense It makes you feel like you are whoever you are in the game If your lebron you find yourself catching up to other players setting up a chase down block where if you are chris paul you ll find yourself setting up for a steal Now i have been reading some reviews up here and on other sites and i am not understanding some of your complaints I read one guys comment that said he blow the computer out on the first game he played I find this highly unlikely unless he played practice for about 4 hours and played on an easy difficulty Reason being is that the controls are completly different You cannot just hop in and do the same thing you were doing last year The first game i played I found myself passing out of shots because i did not know the controls and thought it was like last years Mind you i was playing aganist a friend online who had the game for the whole day and had known what to do so it was a bit bad for me Any way i am also not sure as to why people are so mad about the lack of changes in those modes They were great last year My player could have used a touch up or two but if its not broke why fix it Why go in and make changes to a great system Thats just my opinion To wrap up I really do love this game I will get to spend some more time with it after work but from the 2 games i played it feels so good The timing of the shots the movement of the players the blocking system the ablilty of the ball to always be live and touchable these things and more are why i feel this is a great game Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful cerebralhunt1 9 While as far as graphics go it s the same which isn t a bad thing I m sure they are just getting ready for next gen but the animations are far better for layups dunks and blocks defense is actually do able for once It s actually enjoyable the new passing with the analog stick feels and looks amazing when you get it down its a wonderful new addition The only complaints I really have about the game is with my team if you are beating someone and they get mad and quit it doesn t give you the win because they were disconnected Lastly the controls I m not sure why they consistently feel the need to change them over the years while most of the time it s for the better I feel they should have left them alone they went back to 2k12 to perform a spin move in the lane you spin the analog stick instead of double tapping B which was far more simple to perform a step back you have to push the analog stick back wards as oppposed to tapping B post moves are also done with the analog stick as opposed to double tappig x or b and they didn t move it to make room for something new to me it seemed more like they were just changing the controls for the sake of change maybe to make it seem new and different but it to me it seems largely unnecessary and frustrating because last years controls I felt were the best by far but overall a great game can t wait for next gen Expand 1 of 2 users found this helpful CCkAzE 7 Almost exactly the same game as 2k13 but not quite as polished yet There are better animations and better physics for player collisions but other than that the additions feel pretty much worthless I don t care about the euroleague teams and the Lebron mode isn t even as good as the Jordan mode from 2k12 Also the gameplay has a number of annoying issues that I find rather frustrating 1 Your players will occasionally throw a routine pass way off target for a turnover 2 Even the slightest collisions will sometimes cause your player to lose control of the ball 3 Stripping the ball on defense during a shot animation is WAY too easy now 4 AI players will step out of bounds with the ball ALL THE TIME In fact sometimes they will step out of bounds while you passing it to them charging you with a turnover 5 Blocking shots is WAY too easy I realize it s more fun but it s just not realistic when Stephen Curry has 6 blocks and it s not even halftime Also shorter players will get their shots blocked way more often than in real life I m playing MyCareer on the Cavs and Kyrie Irving probably the best guard in the NBA at finishing around taller players gets his shot blocked at least 3 5 times a game 6 This isn t an issue with the game but I m really annoyed that they totally changed the controls AGAIN Last year you needed to hold L Trigger to pull off a layup or dunk and now if you hold that and hit X it s an alley oop pass So instead of throwing down easy dunks sometimes my muscle memory causes me to throw a wild pass in a random direction usually for a turnover STOP MESSING WITH THE CONTROLS Until this year I would say the NBA 2K series has improved dramatically each year but I m just not feeling like they gave it much effort this year I m sure they will fix some of these annoying problems but overall I m a bit disappointed They really didn t add much to the game at all from last year Honestly 2k13 is a better more polished game right now I d maybe wait until they address some of these issues before buying 2k14 Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful PJTheFadangler 6 I have mixed feelings about this year s release in the NBA 2k series On the one hand I m always happy to have the updated rosters and rookies On the other I don t feel like I ve gotten the value of a new game that cost 60 tax and feels like NBA 2k13 rather than NBA 2k14 I specifically play the 2k series for the My Player Career experience I am not a fan of Lebron and I will not be playing this year s new Lebron centric mode I do not consider the unique modes to be the best or most compelling aspects of the 2k series I played through the Jordan challenges in 2k11 but put far more time into My Player than it took for me to complete Jordan s games This review focuses on the aspect I play We ll start with the positives first Some of the updates to the in game mechanics are good Player movement seems more fluid and smoother I ve found contact is called for a foul more realistically i e if I go for a bad block attempt and land on top of my assigned man I m going to get called for it rather than sliding in next to him It also seems like passes thrown are not as easily picked off by the AI as opposed to previous years where any opponent within 10 feet had a good chance of getting the steal or deflection Another good change is the quick play ability by holding left bumper I ve never been much of a play caller but this change makes it quick and easy The added diversity of special attributes available is also a welcome addition More have been added and there s even more of a strategic balance now between offensive defensive and general abilities Want to become the ultimate defensive stopper You can load up on abilities that negate offensive abilities increase your abilities to strip the ball during dribble moves shots and passes and make you more difficult to get caught on a screen The downside is you won t have much if any room for offensive abilities To shift into things I view as negatives I ll start with something I m ambivalent about the new control scheme using the right stick and other buttons On the one hand it s pretty easy to reliably do specific moves like behind the backs spins etc On the flipside doing a hopstep which in 2k13 was executed by pressing the B button is now done either by double tapping X or in the context of a layup by holding right trigger and holding the right stick to the left or right The main issue is that double tapping X is not reliable at all More often than not My Player simply pulls up and pump fakes I much prefer using the B button If I had to choose I would still opt for the 2k13 control scheme and it s getting a little tiring relearning the controls every year Now for the negatives The game development comes off as being somewhat lazy The graphics don t appear to be upgraded at all I played 2k13 and then 2k14 in front of someone else who plays 2k and neither of us could tell the difference Many of the audio files and commentary are carried over from the previous year The post game press conference questions and answers for My Player are literally identical from the previous year same with the graphics except for maybe the sponsor logo in the background After listening to the 2k13 commentary for at least a couple hundred hours it would have been nice to have totally fresh audio for the new game General player AI continues to be passable at best If anything they now step out of bounds more than before They are also prone to shooting from behind the backboard when on the baseline especially when close to the basket And if I cut off the passing lane to my man sometimes the AI will dribble the shotclock down to 0 with their center out at the 3pt line and proceed to have said center hoist a 3 pointer he has no chance of making These are all carryover issues from past games but stepping out of bounds seems to have worsened And just like in 2k13 the AI refuses to cover me at the 3pt line even with a rating of 85 from that range You can literally sit outside and rain all day Mechanics that are not good Blocking is ridiculously unbalanced in this game I have a rating of 35 block with a 6 7 PG SG and average 4 per game I can come from behind like Lebron on fast breaks and destroy lay up attempts I also routinely block centers and PFs This also leads to a large amount of goal tending Driving the lane isn t worth the risk since you lose the ball very easily The defense doesn t have to actively try to steal the ball so much as run into you The coaching is broken I start at SG with PG as my actual position for OKC and then at the end of games Russell Westbrook rides the bench while I play PG opting to put in a player Jeremy Lamb rated 20 pts lower All in all NBA 2k14 is a very incremental upgrade over NBA 2k13 in the My Player Career department If you really want updated rosters and rookies I d recommend waiting until prices drop picking up a used copy Otherwise pass Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful daical 6 Sure NBA 2K14 is the best

next gen this game is not worth your money The gameplay is fine like usual the new physics engine is cool and the graphics are still good even if many stadiums have gone un updated since NHL 10 It s nothing special It s certainly better than NHL 13 but if you are going to go next gen I would not suggest buying this game unless you are a die hard NHL fan and need to play a fully updated hockey game Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful rugbyelite13 4 i basically think they did a sub par job with this one i am a hard core fan o nthe series and i buy every game as it comes out so iam knowledgeable and also extremely picky the fighting engine is good and needed but basically thats all they concentrated on that only you can tell they game is slow and block feels like moving through water they broke the rebound goal but kept the same defensive systems that force you to use that also it feel laggy and loose the puck kind of bounces around automatically and i do not have much control of the players ofr the action it feels not that exciting to score a goal cause ite feel like the computer did it anyways i am disappointed but will continue to play it all day every day lol and buy every one better luck next time EA Expand 3 of 4 users found this helpful revolvingmonk 4 Quite possibly the worst NHL game yet I mostly play Ultimate Team and the teammate AI is really really horrible this year Every time you get a rush up ice you re going to be alone on the break since the computer feels the need to make line changes whenever someone steps foot into the neutral zone on the rush Ultimate Team online basically amounts to who can score the most top corner goals Every goal is scored in pretty much exactly the same fashion Person with the puck skates low then suddenly changes direction into the slot between the circles and wrists it past your netminder into a top corner while your defense stands there and just lets them walk through Don t even bother trying to get chances from the point Just walk in on the other team skate into the high slot and aim for a top corner you ll pretty much score every single time I really really really wish that 2k would start putting out hockey games again EA clearly hires people that know nothing about the sport and they don t give them the budget to pull things off correctly anyways If the NHL franchise were a bit more like FIFA there wouldn t be half of the problems I seriously doubt I m going to buy another NHL game from EA after this one Expand 1 of 2 users found this helpful Joeychi21 0 nhl 14 is literally the worst EA hockey game ive ever played nhl faceoff 03 has better goalies then this game every single new engine they promised is a LIE GLITCH GOALS R BACK oh im sorry idk we went back in time people it appears that EA knows something about time travel because i just payed for nhl 09 the hitting is unrealistic im sorry im not sure if i payed to play hockey or payed to play UFC undisputed what it all comes down to is that nhl 14 creators literally took a dump in the case n said 60 bucks please Im assuming that Adam Lanza made this game because thats how autistic this game really is Expand 0 of 0

Ccreepincrud 10 OK so you have Pac Man Now you have this Pac Man This IS Pac Man I am amazed how they could improve the formula This game is addicting It s fast paced and there is nothing more satisfying then eating a train of 30 ghosts and wiping out the rest as you keep extending the power pill time I even enjoy the Matrix time effect whenever you are close to getting nailed by a ghost I can t think of any negatives Expand 14 of 14 users found this helpful HyprUbrMtaCritc 10 This game is proof positive that game developers time and effort is better spent on exploring new gameplay mechanics than on striving for photorealistic images and Hollywood style cinematics The developers at Namco instead of asking themselves how to make Pac Man look and sound better poured their energy into figuring out how to make the game more fun This isn t just a modernized or tweaked version of the old arcade game it is a completely new game created specifically for networked home gaming consoles It tosses aside the old notion that a game s objective needs to be about survival and focuses entirely on competitive scoring Reviewers who complained about the near colision slowdown and bombs must not have really thought it through because those elements provide a complexity to the playing stretegy that is absolutely essential Without them there d be a 1 000 way tie for best score on all the lederboards This is a masterpiece of gaming design Expand 2 of 2 users found this helpful Zorgly 10 Easily the most enjoyable adaptation of Pac Man I have ever played It feels great to play

definitely a fun turn on the traditional Pac Man games but I found it to be a bit over priced If you are a Pac Fan then by all means download The graphics are nice sound and music are more modern and

artistic style and energy of the series and is a perfect fit for a high energy pinball table The unique art momentous light saber battles and fast moving action that makes the series so enjoyable translates naturally into an amazing pinball experience Set between the events of the Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones and Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith the Star Wars The Clone Wars pinball table features Anakin Skywalker and his apprentice Ahsoka Tano both represented as 3D characters as well as Asajj Ventress Savage Opress and battle Droids The table would not be complete without a Republic attack gunship which is especially spectacular when the table is played in 3D To start the main table missions light the lamps on the center of the playfield that spell out Citadel by shooting the left and right ramps on the table After spelling the words the ramp s right front side will lower providing a path to the hole to activate the main missions Zen Studios Expand

familiar dialogue and characters usually without any of the silly dolls All this publication s reviews Read full review ZTGDMar 1 2013 95 What really brings these to life is the attention to detail Zen worked closely with Lucasfilm to capture all the essence of the Star Wars universe Whenever new dialogue was needed the studio created it for Zen This was a collaborative effort that heightens the experience The layout of each table is recognizable and the care packed in will bring a smile to Star Wars fans young and old All this publication s reviews Read full review LevelUpMar 20 2013 91 The three tables included in this DLC are among the most interesting and awe inspiring ones so far Fans of the Star Wars saga will have a hard time trying to reach a high score and taking in all the

of 8 Sandrick 10 As a huge pinball and Star Wars fan I have been looking forward to the release ever since I heard about it weeks ago Finally I can say whole heartedly after playing it all morning that I love these tables A lot of care was taken to give it those subtle touches that pinball tables have always had from the electric display at the top showing scenes from the movie to the name input being modeled after the carbonite slab display it is all there I was geeking out for hours at the love that they have shown the SW franchise as well as great pinball action It is unfortunate that they couldn t use Harrison s voice from the movies but the actor still hits it pretty close My Fav is the Episode V table closely followed by Boba Fett and then the Clone Wars The constant brightness of the lightsabers on the last one I found slightly distracting at times Finally I feel that the Pinball Hall of Fame collections have a slightly more true Feel to the real thing since those are REAL tables However as far as designing new beautiful tables that I WISH were real this is the best you can do These three tables are worth every penny Expand 3 of 5 users found this helpful TheMadSaint 9 As soon as news first struck the gaming feed section of my Lumia phone it was as if I had died and gone to a hybrid heaven of Starwars and pinball Out of the three stunning tables created by Zen my natural Starwars instincts drew me of course to the Empire Strikes back and as soon as the Lightsaber s pull back spring shot my first ball into the abyss of droids and wampa s I was hooked For some reason the original voices of the characters lines have been re done by voice actors albeit very professionally but to the fellow die hard it s noticeable All In this is a very fast paced table with a lot of interesting concepts not seen from any other table Zen has to offer Next on my hit list was the Fett table and as soon as the game loaded it was distinguishable by it s very long and narrow horse s head shape Zen have gone for The Return Of The Jedi look and have the sound effects from the film to support the Fetts own table with a lot of emphasis on the Sarlacc pit As previously mentioned the table is incredibly long which means that some parts look squashed and in certain areas it s hard to see whats happened to your valued ball None the less it s still a fun table and when the Fett utilizes his grappling hook to save the ball from being lost it screams awesome The third and final table was left till last due to the Clone Wars not being very high on my radar in recent years so off the bat this table was not high on my priority list The table opens up to a very wide and beautifully created area with an escape pod being deployed upon pull back of your ball A mini Anakin can be seen responding to where the ball is run and the sound effects are full of Star Wars charm my one complaint would be the odd Yoda phrase that is spewed out every ten seconds which didn t really seem to make much sense and was not in line with the Yoda we all listened to in the Empire Strikes Back To sum up all three tables have a lot of what made us all fall for the franchise in the first place Some tables will be liked better than others and this is why for 800 MS points and a bit of supple pinball finger flicking you should just go for it and wonder what s just happened to the last three hours of your life Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful Xenugears 9 Immensely addicting Perhaps 10 is a little high for just three tables but a the tables are a blast pun intended and b the Star Wars themes are a perfect fit for pinball This game does for pinball what Pac Man Championship DX did for well Pac Man Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Xenonexe2558 9 These are the first FX s tables I ve wished were real They re simply well put together fun tables that play well and make great use of the licence It s unfortunate they couldn t use real sync voice quotes but that s the only real criticism the GFX music and SFX are all top notch Expand 2 of 3 users found this helpful Kormiko 8 I ve played most if not all of the pinball tables available from Pinball FX2 The Star Wars Pinball tables are as fun as I had hoped Boba Fett is my favorite of the three Not just because of the character but because it has a sense of grittiness to its design ESB is a little difficult to figure out at first but it has just enough differences from normal tables to make it enjoyable The only one that doesn t impress me as much as those two is the Clone Wars table I like the animated series but I kept wanting to play the other two more Perhaps I need more time with it I don t have much more to say since there are free demos for you to try them I hope that these are successful so that we get to have like Cantina Dagobah and Coruscant pinball tables in the future Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful Tidechamp15 3 Being a huge Star Wars and pinball fan I was sure these tables would be utopia for me Man was I wrong All of the tables are frustratingly fast with table mechanics that delight in flinging the ball at blazing speed either down the middle or corner chutes Even after reading all the table guides I often was confused as to where I should be trying to go next with the ball Only Clone Wars does a decent job of not overwhelming you with targets and mini games If you want to gnash your teeth in anger while admiring nice Star Wars theming then go ahead and waste 10 Expand 1 of 5 users found this helpful denilsoneldios 2 digo que el

ending is so good Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful imautobot 10 This review contains spoilers click expand to view This game is a lot more fun than the original I don t agree with reviewers claiming the graphics looked dated it s definitely an upgrade from the first portal Is it short Well it was longer than I expected so that was refreshing but once you know how to solve the puzzles you could probably beat it in 4 hours but I guarantee you your first run through will not be so easy to pull off Replay value is HIGH I m on my 3rd time through Co op is good if you have a friend physically by your side but it s frustrating online Gaming with strangers causes frustration and game drops The GLaDOS wit is back and when she s not saying snarky witty things you get it from about 3 other characters voices The developers have added now portal elements like a light bridge a anti gravity tunnel repulsion gel acceleration gel and a white portal enabling gel These new game dynamics change the way you have to experience the game and it s quite a fun experience as a result The developer commentary wasn t as involved as the original portal commentary and lacked observations from the voice over talent But some of the commentary actually flew right over my head because of how technical it actually was The ending seemed to eliminate the franchise so that s a bummer But I really enjoyed this game and will continue to enjoy the game Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful rifter89 10 Amazing just like the first one The fact that you actually have to use your brain alittle to advance through the story makes it a much better game then a run and gun game like CoD Brilliant Expand 10 of 11 users found this helpful GaryGamesoup 9 THE GOOD Stephen Merchant as Wheatley is an absolute masterstroke A consistently brilliant tightly crafted campaign with some of the funniest lines of dialogue you will experience in a game for a long long long time Banging co op campaign Mobility Gels add a whole new dimension to the puzzles THE BAD The uhh poor subtitle grammar offends me at times it it s forgiven Graphics 8 In terms of visual quality it s identical to Portal but that s not a bad thing as Portal s graphics were smooth clean cut and beautifully sterile to fit with the theme of the evil Aperture Science facility of course and so it s no surprise that this exact formula was brought in for a second round only now the facility is in a state of decay since Chell s last battle with GLaDOS and so our vision of what was once Aperture Science is thrown sideways as we awake in a seemingly brand new place with overgrown weeds poking through every available orifice and the sort of run down factory setting that only Bear Grylls would spend the night in As the game

than a trailer or two However I have played through the first Portal 5 or 6 times Even after you know all the puzzles the first game is just that compelling In Portal 2 I just got to Chapter 5 and it seems to me to be just as engrossing at the first Portal The dialogue is just as dark and full of genius as the original and the learning curve of the puzzles steps you into it perfectly just like the original game Luckily I played the game for a few hours before wandering into the Steam forums and reading the hate mail I was astonished to read the things people were saying about this game even though after what happened with Left 4 Dead 2 I shouldn t have been Don t listen to the nay saying There are small critiques even with the most perfect games Bottom line if you liked Portal this sequel will take you back into that world in a very awesome way Expand 6 of 8 users found this helpful nader03isdaman 0 Bull S score GOTY 2011 Batman Arkham City Worst GOTY Portal 2 Portal 1 was pretty bad but at least it was only a few hours this game is too long I don t want to have to waste my brain power over this when i could be playing a decent game like Batman Arkham City or StarCraft

installment won t beat the original However Rayman Legends traverses this belief with its unshaken confidence and it sets forward the whole Rayman series to the new LEGENDARY level All this publication s reviews Read full review EurogamerAug 26 2013 100 The platform game has been around for so long that it s easy to assume that the genre has run out of surprises A showcase for the game designer s art and one of the greatest platform games of this or any year Rayman Legends disproves that in glorious style All this publication s reviews Read full review AusGamersAug 30 2013 93 It combines the simple elegance bountiful content and colourful enjoyment of so many indie works with the production values and design genius of the generation s best Triple A titles into a game that feels fresh and contemporary but also mindful of what has come and worked before All this publication s reviews Read full review GameSpotAug 26 2013 90 It uses absurd scenes to imbue this feisty adventure with enough variety to keep you continually amazed and presents every disparate scenario with expert care Rayman Legends off kilter identity serves as the foundation for this wild and crazy journey All this publication s reviews Read full review Gamereactor DenmarkAug 27 2013 90 Rayman Origins the predecessor to Legends was one of the best platform games of this generation and Rayman Legends has it squarely beat across the line It may well be that the main character is 18 a practical lifetime in game terms but he certainly doesn t feel that way Rayman feels refreshing like few others All this publication s reviews Read full review DestructoidAug 27 2013 85 Rayman Legends is occasionally flustering and sometimes seems to demand more than a conventional controller is capable of The surprisingly slapdash jury rigging of Wii U features on other systems is glaring in its inelegance too However we re still left with an impressively designed platformer that proves itself a worthy followup to Rayman Origins making a few notable omissions but adding some excellent new ideas of its own All this publication s reviews Read full review VideoGamerAug 26 2013 80 Stand out

to wait until later to try out the online games but if you re looking for a good platform game with lots of challenges and tons of content this game is for you Expand 8 of 10 users found this helpful Dobrein 10 So fcking awesome Awesome graphics awesome gameplay so fun to play with friend You MUST try it out Musical levels at the end of chapters best levels in the game Expand 2 of 2 users found this helpful naiv69 10 I enjoyed Rayman Origins but the checkpoints and level design where not as good as this the game is gorgeous and the sounds are funny and the game is sweet and fun but also it can get very difficult on some later levels overall this is a great platformer with beautiful design and well thought out levels and a decent challenge and one of the best games i have played in a while and totally worth every penny just play the demo and see Expand 3 of 3 users found this helpful Bramsterdam 9 I miss the challenging chest levels but the music levels are a blast great game to play with the girlfriend thats for sure enjoyed the first one and I enjoyed this one The only sad part is that I ve collected all 700 guys and I m done with the game Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful feliarroyo 9 Finally a sequel to the amazing Rayman Origins has arrived The 2d visuals are probably some of the best of all time I ve seen in video games It almost looks like a moving painting sometimes The soundtrack is amazing with a more epic feel than Origins and the musical levels are definitely the best levels of the game The gameplay from the original stays mostly unchanged but there are some differences Instead of rescuing Electoons you now rescue Teensies The secret areas still appear in the game but I can t help but feel that some of these are a little bit too easy The teensies can also be found in the normal path another big difference This makes the levels feature lots of them to rescue increasing the replay value The controls are the same as Rayman Origins only including a button to control Murphy He controls well in this version but was obviously meant for the Wii U The replay value of this game is immense even considering the Origins aproximately 300 electoons to collect There are more than 400 teensies to collect through the levels lots of characters to unlock and even Origins stages redesigned to play There are also creatures that you obtain with lucky tickets lottery tickets that either have a teensie an Origins level a large amount of lums or one of this creatures that give you lums There are two extra modes Kung Foot and the Challenges The Challenges are online competitions and very addictive ones They will keep you playing probably months after you finish the game The Kung Foot mini game on the other hand its offline I couldn t believe it myself but Rayman is a surprisingly entertaining football game It is a small distraction that you will play for hours when you aren t playing the challenging levels In the end Rayman Legends is a worthy sequel to the underrated platformer maybe it feels a little bit too easy at times but closer to the end it shows it s Nintendo Hard difficulty the only mayor problem I found is that in multiplayer the punches STILL affect your partners This makes playing with friends a little annoying Otherwise Rayman Legends is probably one of the best 2D platformers of the generation Expand 5 of 7 users found this helpful KizaruAMV 9 It s been a long time since I ve enjoyed a 2D platformer of this calibre Rayman Legends excels in so many areas The magnificent art style soundtrack controls and level design leave me only wanting more Expand 2 of 3 users found this helpful szaberto 0 This game is terrible Yes the graphics are pretty and the animations and sound effects and all But the game itself is upright terrible The level design is boring linear and way too easy I don t get how reviews can say it has improved upon origins The gameplay here is not even close to origins it was dumbed down for the very casual players so a 7 year old can pick it up and play with daddy and have a good time After all this was supposed to be kind of a wii u exclusive family game Do yourself a favor and stay the hell away from this or at least know what to expect if you buy it And the murphy controls are clunky and awkward at first but you can get used to it And the joke is that I ended up enjoying the murphy levels more because at least they had some sort of challange but again It s a completely different gameplay This is not a good game So If you like easy games with pretty graphics this is for you But if you want more than just watching a movie where you happen to control the main character and shoot things and stuff then don t feed ubisoft with your money Expand 2 of 30 users found

Rockstar Advanced Game Engine RAGE Red Dead Redemption features an open world environment for players to explore including frontier towns rolling prairies teeming with wildlife and perilous mountain passes each packed with an endless flow of varied distractions Along the way players experience the heat of gunfights and battles meet a host of unique characters struggle against the harshness of one

horse shooting people on other horses Without lock on you d never hit anything as the action is too fast and people don t just stand there to let you shoot them That s why you can go manual in Dead Eye mode because it slows everything down to possible speeds It is a joy to ride around the countryside and the random events that happen there really break up any monotony you might feel Expand 32 of

even used fast travel because this world is so spectacular 10 10 by far Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful CodyB 10 Let me start off by saying that I was not a fan of the Grand Theft Auto series so I was very hesitant to pick this up This game has everything I imagined a game could be I m not going to write a huge review and pick it apart but I will say this the gunplay the voice acting the story are all top notch It s been a long time since I have invested in a game for this long I m just glad I am not completely finished with it Bring on the DLC Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful GarryRyder 10 Best gunslinging game Rockstar Games ever made Clearly beats out its superhit Grand Theft Auto IV The gameplay s great The cutscenes are better than GTA IV in all aspects The graphics of the game is amazing The storyline s great Great game It worthed every penny i bought I wasted my money on a great game So no worries Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful whit 9 Yep it s just as good s everyone says it is There are a couple of periods where things move a bit slowly and the aiming assist is probably a little too helpful but these are very minor complaints for a great game Expand 0

leave you bored after a few hours Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful 2ksnipefest 1 This game is GTH What a lame way to travel Why do western movies stink The same thing here It s boring and time consuming and not fun Play GTA 3 or Vice city instead Its less money and way more fun Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful See all 281 User Reviews Trailers Red Dead Redemption Gentlemen and

drugs and rock n roll The biker movement rock music and the hippie counterculture all add to the fascinating atmosphere to be experienced in Ride to Hell Action loaded from the very start with free roaming environments players can immerse themselves in the liberty and freedom of riding full throttle with their gang on a multitude of different vehicles through the dusty flats of Western America Protecting their turf their brothers and their machines from rival gangs is just a taste of what this epic game involves Ride to Hell is not for the faint hearted it s aimed heavily at the player who wants to become fully involved in the original West Coast biker culture With its hard drinking bare knuckle environment this is as close to the action as you can get Deep Silver Expand Developer Deep

soundtrack to really get the adrenaline pumping The story of one man s search for the truth about his father is full of intricate plot twists and told in a gripping narrative supported by an array of characters with emotional depth From the trailer yard to the distillery this game will have you on the edge of your seat Expand 6 of 40 users found this helpful Vrabac 2 We were promised a 60 s

hell because anything this glitchy this boring and this awful will force anyone to ride to the darkest depths of hell Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful Nyxx 0 This game sucks Let me get it out of the way right now This is without a doubt the worst game of 2013 thus far That said you must play this game or watch a let s play of it It s absolutely hilarious Not worth 30 of your own money but hilarious nonetheless Performance Looks like an early era PS2 game The models are weird and blocky textures are exceedingly horrible and glitches pop up all over the place Throw in random crashes and just as random FPS dives you have a game that one may consider Not very optimized and good looking They re that bad Sound About six or seven music tracks that repeat throughout the entire game You ll grow bored with them quickly The sound effects are weak and makes it seem like you re hitting your foes with Nerf weapons However the saving grace is the hilariously bad voice acting The VA is Resident Evil 1 quality and that s not entirely a bad thing Just about every line in this game is read so awkwardly it s sure to bring a smile to your face Control I won t be judging the game s control as much as I ll be judging the lack of it There are two modes in the game When you re on a motorcycle and when you re on foot On a motorcycle the controls are hilariously bad There s no physics you awkwardly slide around on the bike and the Powerslide move is you just have to see it What s not so hilarious is the combat on a cycle To beat enemies you have to mash a button until a bar is full then they re instantly killed Repeat about 10 times per section It s not great On foot you have full access to your weapons You can point shoot and take cover generic stuff but you can also like Dead to Rights Retribution mix it up with melee combat And just like in Dead to Rights Retribution it doesn t work very well Melee combat works like this Preform the guard block on someone mash the attack button repeat There s a counter mechanic like Arkham Asylum City but it doesn t serve that much of a purpose since most of the fist fights are painfully easy and repetitive Occasionally the protagonist gets mad and makes a hilarious scream and then preforms an insta kill QTE that actually takes longer to kill the enemies as opposed to just hitting them Worth seeing at least once Gunplay well it works You can shoot things but even the tutorial games developed in the Gamemaker engine can pull that off The real issue is a lot of the controls revolve around QTEs That s not okay at all Gameplay You play as Jake Conway the son of William Conway who was part of a bike gang known as Retribution Your brother was killed by a rival gang named The Devil s Hand and Jake is out for revenge Don t worry the story doesn t get any deeper than this and just about everyone has no character development at all With a storyline as simple as this they certainly did a good job making it seem more complicated than it really is The beginning of the game is nothing but a swarm of flashbacks and it does a great job confusing you However the best part of this game are the cutscenes with many of them making no sense and all of them poorly done in a hilarious fashion The cycle segments are super repetitive with the same dull combat all the way through More excitingly sometimes your bike will randomly explode and you ll have to load from the last checkpoint On foot enemies range from generic thin goons who take only a few punches shots to take out to Jason wannabes who are damn near immune to everything I wasted what seemed like fifty bullets trying to take one out Supposedly you have to destroy a barrel to kill them more efficiently but doing so only screwed up my screen and did damage to me All the guns are boring and the melee combat is spam y as all get out The boss fights are all gimmicks The first one being you chasing him down on a bike with a machine gun You literally have no room for error and every time you fail it s all the way at the beginning of the segment The checkpoints in this game are the worst I ve seen in a while You die you re doing a 20 minute segment over again more often than not After that you have a town where you can buy weapons and upgrade your bike The bike upgrade system isn t bad but it s completely pointless There s not much else to do other than go to the next mission Oh there are sex scenes where you take the women of the Devil s Hand after beating up their lovers While fully clothed There s even a five on one situation where everyone is clothed So don t worry not only are they being blatantly sexist every woman is there for sex they re also being exceedingly stupid This was originally gonna be a sandbox game like GTA And I like the ideas it had A year after that they rushed it after realized they didn t either have the ability or the time and we get this glitchy barely playable mess Hilarious to watch but don t buy it yourself Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful LogicalEagle123 0 Looks like Fast and Furious Showdown has some competition I ve played some PS2 games that had better graphics and physics than this atrocity It should be a crime to sell this game anywhere in the world This is probably the worst video game of this generation and one of the worst games of all time Its not worth 15 its not worth 10 its not worth 5 its not worth five cents The only reason one should ever buy this game is to get a good laugh at how terrible it is Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful minalear 0 This game is just a pile of garbage I am the type of person who would try to look at the bright side of everything this game has one redeeming quality The game falls short on many if not all key points of what makes a game a game The graphics are alright in some places but absolutely terrible in many more The games mechanics are super clunky and unresponsive The game also lacks visual and audible feedback letting you know if you re doing something right or wrong Sound is by far the worst part of this game It lacks a lot of sound effects and the ones that it does have are awful For example this is a biker game One of the key points of a biker game is the motorcycle The bikes in this game literally sound like weed wackers The game s ONE redeeming factor is the music only because they use proprietary licenses instead of in house music The one redeeming factor however doesn t matter if music isn t played Many a level I went through without music ever playing Checkpointing is piss poor story is uninspired combat is bad multiplayer is boring Just don t buy this game This is an example of a quickly put together game made solely for profit Expand 4 of 5 users found this helpful AngryJoesnum1Fa 0 ROFL LMAO

of 22 GeekOrthodox 10 Everyone has talked about how the rhythm gaming genre has been in slow decline for years but fortunately no on at Harmonix took these claims seriously Rock Band 3 innovates that game in nearly every way possible and includes nearly all features that fans have requested for years The biggest innovations are the addition of keys and Pro Mode Keys a 2 5 octave midi keyboard that can be played sitting or as a keytar adds the last traditional rock instrument to the mix With keys and harmony vocals as first seen in The Beatles Rock Band you can now have up to 7 players simultaneously rocking out Pro Mode is Harmonix s response to the ever present question Why don t you just learn to play real instruments Playing Pro Mode on Expert that is exactly what you re doing You re playing the actual guitar bass drum and keyboard parts While not as flashy the new song management system is crucial for Rock Band players with hundreds of songs in their collection Also handy is the ability to save custom playlists The song selection is a great mix of classic hits new stuff and deep cuts The only cons I can see 1 A few songs from RB1 and RB2 won t transfer into the RB3 library 2 Gone are crowd singalongs for RB3 on disc songs 3 To get the full Rock Band experience you need to spend a lot of money to get a pro guitar keys drum cymbals and all the great DLC that is available All in all this is a landmark game and the pinnacle of the rhythm gaming genre Expand 12 of 16 users found this helpful Nathanielx 10 This is the music game that the genre has been waiting for and the possible savior that it needs Taking the only good part of Guitar Hero the drop in drop out and improving it then adding keyboards harnony vocals from The Beatles Rock Band and getting rid of that repetitive World Tour Mode you have the apex of rhythm gaming I m not going to mention Pro Guitar although it s a very interesting idea because I have not played it myself But even without it this game is a must have if you have any interest in this genre I will say that Pro Keyboards while supremely difficult are quite well done and fun This will be a stand out instrument once more DLC featuring this instrument is made available such as the upcoming Billy Joel stuff They have taken the challenges of Rock Band 2 and worked them into a very endearing set of challenges to make up a tour that should take you about a week This mode is complete with videos that for the first time feel like they give your band members a personality These are hysterical the first time you see them and you really start thinking of your characters as a real band Not only that but everything you do even when you just mess around playing songs in the quickplay mode it counts towards your band progress and unlockable clothing There were a lot of complaints about the setlist early on mostly because the bands for the 2000 s were not really well known but most of those songs grow on you if you give them a chance That is the beauty of Harmonix games they can turn you into fans of new bands and show you that there is more to music than your own jaded point of view For example you do discover that Amy Winehouse despite her personal problems is talented at what she does or that Metric have a really great sound I think that all the positive reviews from critics and players alike is proof that this is a great game I know the genre has suffered from over exposure and the fact that in general a rhythm game is just trying to hit the right buttons to play the song the best you can However Harmonix have taken that as far as they could with this edition There are a few things that could ve been better but they are minor and do not affect the fun such as when you have more than 5 or more players you still only see 4 on the screen or that in all instrument mode which is the mode that is required to have bass guitar and keyboards on a song the vocals are not scored But this game is about the fun and easy to use interface If you have an open mind this game will make you happy Expand 1 of 2 users found this helpful HankG 10 To be brief this game is a masterpiece among the video game industry as well as the music There is so much to do here from diddling a keyboard on pro mode confusing your hands on pro drums or just simply singing back up for one of your friends If this is were they end the series then they will be ending on a high note Unlike some companies Expand 7 of 10 users found this helpful biscuitboy46 9 Rock Band 3 is easily one of the best games I have ever played Harmonix did a fantastic job on this rhythm game The song playlist is huge most of my favorite metal bands were on the Rock Band Network I frequently play this game with my friends instead of Call of Duty and Guitar Hero Overall a great music game I really couldn t find that many things wrong with it Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful agking 9 Great Game but still hase it s bad moments Music selection is awesome and the keyboard great but the presentation isn t as good as Rock Band 2 I also dislike the camera changes and how they don t go very well together Singing is great Exporting Rock Band 2 songs is available but sucks because some songs aren t there But it s just rock band so I will have to give it a 9 10 Expand 1 of 2 users found this helpful Trasser 8 To be honest i haven t played or own this game yet but if its like and or better than the second Rock Band this one is something to put on your wish list for sure Expand 1 of 3 users found this helpful Seba 3 This game was a HUGE letdown i love the second and i gave it a 10 10 for its amazing set list and how realistic the tabs were The only thing that is good about the third one is for how realistic its tabs are and how many song are available for download I bought the pro drums for 130 bucks and they would randomly fall apart and hit notes aromatically without me even playing them I sold them to gamestop and i got a new one and i got the same problem Right now i am heading to gamestop to get as much money as i can to get for this worthless game Expand 2 of 7 users found this helpful See all

game is amazing and deep Very well made A great party game that gets you very invovled Having fans and little challenges in the gigs kinda like Fable s bast system is an ingenious way to make you more invested in your performances It s not without it s faults though The interface is a little klunky and user unfriendly Navigating the menus is much much harder than it should be They ve made some poor choices to make the game user unfriendly why is solo play only for singers I realize you can go into multiplayer and just do one instrument but the tags solo and mulit are a bit deceptive no And why is it that if I set a band leader I can never change his her instrument plus I HAVE to play with that guy all the time Sometimes you just get sick of singing P This was a very poor choice Giving players more freedom is always a good thing Most of these things can be forgiven but I would advise Harmonix to WATCH a few new players try to navigate their menus and set up a band and play the game for the next round of RB Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful XanN 8 This game is awesome It far exceeds the GH series if nothing else just for the multiple instruments The drums are by far my favorite Now for the bad things I ve had two guitars break on me not user fault by any means and the user interface of the game is horrible Once you establish a leader you have to continue to use that leader and whatever instrument you started with at the beginning That means that your custom made character can t switch between instruments Oh and STEVE you can do a solo career with any of the instruments Don t turn on your xbox with your 360 controller That will automatically make you the singer Plug in the guitar or drums and then turn on your xbox then use said controller to navigate the menus Overall this game is excellent for parties Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful RyanF 0 Not worth the price Broke already 0 of 0 users found this helpful See all 67 User Reviews Trailers Rock

especially Beat and Runner so I was really excited to see the early screenshots of this game It obviously looks different than the original s 8 bit retro style but the core mechanics remain The greatest draw of Runner 2 is the trance you have to slide into in order to play it it demands that your full attention so that you can kick jump slide etc on time The music is awesome and it responds to you as you progress For 15 bucks you can t beat this It sucks you in and makes you forget about how crappy your life really is Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful Palindromes17 10 This is kind of like if Super Meat Boy and Guitar Hero had an electronic baby In other words it s amazing It works as a great platformer and rhythm music game Buy this game You won t be disappointed Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful FearBeard 9 great rythm platformer game thats just as addictive as RockBand at times the levels can be quite difficult but the game has 3 difficulty settings the levels are varied but short enough that its a great pick up play game the music is memorable and catchy making you want to re play levels and perfect them Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful heegs 9 If not for the challenge buy this game for the music the visuals and the narration by Super Mario himself They kept this sequel challenging for those returning to the series and have made life easier by adding checkpoints for those looking for a more casual experience Though you will find yourself repeating levels to unlock new characters items etc you ll also find that each visit to an old level is just as rewarding and thrilling as it was the first time through Bravo Runner 2 bravo Expand 2 of 3 users found this helpful drlowdon 8 Despite owning a Nintendo Wii I d never played any of the previous Bit trip titles released over the last few years Having seen the universalally positive reviews for Runner 2 however I decided to download the demo from Xbox Live Arcade and within twenty minutes I was purchasing the full game The idea is simply to guide your character to the end of the level as they run relentlessly from left to right across the screen In the first couple of levels the only input needed is to jump over enemies and platforms but pretty soon the game introduces more elements such as a slide to duck under certain obstacles and a shield with which to deflect incoming projectiles Each level also features gold and score multipliers to collect too for those interested in achieving higher scores for the online leaderboards Runner 2 certainly gets difficult in later levels but thanks to its well managed difficulty curve and precise controls it is very rare that it becomes frustrating The hugely satisfying interactive soundtrack only adds to the experience further and it s very easy to become lost in some kind of trance as you guide your character along The praise for Runner 2 is certainly justified and at around 10 there won t be many games released this year that offer better value for money Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful VonSeux 5 The music aspect of the game is overrated Really soundtrack was much better on the first Bit Trip games when you really felt you were Making the songs That said I like the new graphic style and scoring system and the game can keep you on the sofa for a couple hours But after that gameplay has too many imputs that it s hard to remember all the combinations unless you re a OCD that almost kills any replayability because you have to learn all over again Expand 1 of 3 users found this helpful Trailers

Saints Row IV the pace has drastically increased and I find myself giddy while playing it because it is literally everything I had hoped for from this game I would heavily suggest this game if you enjoyed Prototype or Crackdown because I feel it is more fun than both of them combined Also while I think that this game probably deserves a 8 I am giving it a 10 because no game deserves a rating of 0 Expand 7 of 18 users found this helpful hunters44 10 This is the most fun I ve ever had playing a video game Saints Row has finally let grand theft auto grab up the gang style realism and has completely immersed itself in the insane charm that the previous titles only dreamt of Ask nothing of this game and this game will give you hours of nothing Just flying around or super kicking aliens in the balls or destroying city blocks with dub step The new alien vehicles are fun the superpowers are amazing and the weapons have introduced the deepest level of customization Saints has ever attempted Brilliant good fun Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful WithheldStorm 9 This review contains spoilers click expand to view I love this game I really love this game I love it so much that I just haven t stopped playing it The funny moments in the game are hilariously good including all the super powers and weapons The twists turns were completely unexpected especially the return of Johnny Gat Alive Kicking and the surprise arrival of WWE Hall of Fame Superstar Rowdy Roddy Piper not to mention all the sex The only down sides to the game are the occasional glitches crashes freezes that really must be sorted out ASAP Apart from that I can t wait for Saints Row 5 Expand 1 of 3 users found this helpful TundraFreeze 8 It is the humour weapons characters and occasional quirky gameplay that makes this a somewhat unique game However for the most part the gameplay itself feels too much like Prototype and Crackdown Instead of making a silly GTA4 version which is what Saint s Row 3 was they made a silly Prototype Crackdown version One thing that annoyed me is that you get all the superpowers pretty much from the beginning which is not a good thing Even though you can jump into cars and drive around there is no practical reason to do so because your jumping and running superpowers will get you there faster So the driving function is completely wasted in this game Also as far as over the top gameplay goes I honestly think Deadpool did it better The concept and storyline of the game is OK but I would definetely have preferred something closer to Saint s Row 2 and 3 Something closer to Earth All in all you will probably like this game if you enjoy games such as Deadpool Protoype and Crackdown Deadpool in particular Expand 1 of 3 users found this helpful SimpleMethod 7 Saints Row IV is amazing It s honestly a ton of fun Don t be wavered by the fact that they recycled the city there is a LOT more content in this game then there is in The Third The character and car creator have been beefed up significantly and the super powers are awesome Playing online with a friend is about as close to Justice League as it gets Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful Cosmolu 5 After the amazing spectacle that was Saints Row The Third I was incredibly excited to see Volition take the series a step further into the purely ludicrous Unfortunately Saints Row IV simply can t shake the fact that it started as a DLC add on to its predecessor and as a result fails to deliver a memorable experience of its own As the story begins the Saints are now in the White House with your titular main character taking the role of Commander in Chief Not soon thereafter aliens invade and place the Saints in a Matrix style computer simulation where most of the game takes place This simulation is a virtual recreation of Steelport from SR3 and IV disappointingly brings nothing new to the table by way of setting Not only is it the exact same layout from before the entirety of the game takes place at night Steelport didn t have a ton of personality to begin with and shrouding the city in darkness certainly doesn t help that fact One of the primary selling points for Saints Row IV is the superpowers that you incrementally learn through the course of the game It doesn t take long at all before you re sprinting faster than a race car scaling buildings in a single bound and shooting fireballs from your fingertips The whole thing feels ripped right out of Prototype and Crackdown complete with orbs scattered throughout the city to improve your abilities and it s appropriately fun to fling yourself through the Steelport skyline at 100mph However the superpowers quickly become a double edged sword As soon as you get your increased mobility there is absolutely no reason to drive a car again In fact there s hardly a reason to touch the ground again The entire bottom half of the world is forgotten as you bound from one objective to the other So on top of the uninteresting setting shrouded in darkness the game actively encourages you to only traverse the even less interesting building tops throughout your travels It seems like Volition realized this so the game is peppered with constant and arbitrary reasons for you to lose your superpowers These seem forced because they are and it s unfortunate that better reasons couldn t be found to keep your feet on the ground After all the powers run their course however Saints Row IV doesn t have much else to say The story is needlessly stretched to full game length by repetitive missions and an over emphasis on side mission activities What story there is doesn t hold water either I d be lying if I said I didn t laugh often while playing SR IV but it chooses to focus far too heavily on waxing nostalgic over providing a satisfying narrative Everything follows a predictable path and what should have been an epic clash to send off the series with a bang ends up being a redundant slog that presents its finale with a whimper The humor in Saints Row has always been one of its strongest suits but even here things have taken a downturn It seems like Volition has forgotten the difference between parody and reference and as a result falls into the Matt Hazard trap of simply recreating tired video game tropes and then calling them out It s the developers wanting to have their cake and eat it too exploiting lazy design shortcuts an overabundance of fetch quests comes to mind and hoping to get away with it by pointing out how bad it is This problem is pushed to its derivative limits through your spaceship and crew which is a shameless rip off of the entire structure of Mass Effect 2 without even trying to be funny about it This is all irritating on its own but the myriad of bugs and glitches were enough to send me over the edge Throughout my playthrough I encountered no less than 4 game breaking bugs which caused be to restart from a checkpoint or reboot the console entirely From scripted events not triggering to NPC characters getting stuck in the game world to full on crashes the entire experience felt sloppy and unstable And no the fact that it s set in a computer simulation is not an adequate excuse In the end I feel that Saints Row IV would have been better staying as the DLC pack Enter the Dominatrix for a budget price The recycled content lackluster story and half hearted execution make it impossible to recommend at the full 60 price point even for die hard Saints Row fans Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful mone06 0 This game is like playing Saints Row 3 while on an acid trip Why Same exact thing as the previous installment But oh wait some how i got super powers and did i forget to mention i get to become the president of the good old U S of A

have no taste for the good stuff you should go out waste your hard earn 60 bucks on this soon to be bargain bin game or you can get your money s worth buy picking up GTA V SAME PRICE If GTA not your

or guesswork like some strategy games All this publication s reviews Read full review EurogamerJan 30 2013 90 Fast compact and yet consistently thoughtful there s nothing else quite like Skulls of the Shogun and for me it earns its place amongst the genre s greats All this publication s reviews Read full review Vandal OnlineFeb 11 2013 85 A great choice full of humor for those who want to get started in the genre Long time fans may find it easy and we were expecting a deeper gameplay but still a great recommendation All this publication s reviews Read full review Games Master UKOct 24 2012

strategy fans and manages successfully to bring turn based strategy in the hands of all Its accessibility its quality its balanced deep yet simple gameplay everything was designed to go straight to what matters while polishing the details With its cross platform multiplayer and a very nice funny atmosphere it may very well be the perfect entry point to a genre that is more often than not perceived as dull and complicated All this publication s reviews Read full review Digital SpyFeb 4 2013 80 The enemy AI is deviously smart and will not hesitate to take advantage of every trick you

publication s reviews Read full review EGMJan 30 2013 60 Objectivity is an illusion Perceptions and subjectivity prevail powerfully influenced by expectations both personal and cultural Culturally we want the Great Gaming Renaissance and we look to indie games to bring it to us I want to love Skulls of the Shogun for all that I see it can be but I have to like Skulls for all that it is Part of that includes being boring All this publication s reviews Read full review See all 48 Critic Reviews User Reviews Write a Review Score distribution Positive 4 out of 5 Mixed 1 out of 5 Negative 0 out of 5 Kasseem 10 Simplistic and also with a great amount of depth Meaning it s easy for players to get into but also has enough meat and potatoes for hardcore players to spend many hours after the campaign to better refine their strategy During the journey of the afterlife the player will encounter just the right amount of new mechanics that it never gets boring but also never feels overwhelming It has an excellent learning curve with a few potential difficultly spikes depending on your skill level but feels that much more rewarding once the player has overcome such obstacles The dialog is also something to mention as it is quite funny most of the time by either making old movie references or breaking the forth wall After the Campaign multiplayer is where you ll refine your skills either locally online normal ranked or asynchronously play by mail basically Async is particularly nice if you happen to have a windows phone or windows 8 tablet as it lets you play one turn and send it to your opponent then come back hours later to see how your opponent responded to your actions With 30 multiplayer maps specifically design and well balanced so far between 2 3 and 4 players there s a ton of game for just 15 Highly recommended Expand 2 of 3 users found this helpful Themisterchief 10 Skulls of the shogun s simplicity yet the dept offers itself open for a a newcomer like myself to pick up and play The user interface offers every move you can make with prominent button prompts every time you take control of you units The games s story mode introduces different stages and scenarios against enemy units This mode can be approached by new comers and learn the game s basic mechanics and objectives Multiplayer offer a turn based strategy game at its finest with async or online multiplayer Every move counts in Skulls multiplayer This game s cross platform multiplayer mode is seamless and very good version of the game all around Expand 1 of 2 users found this helpful thedeadknighf 10 This game is just solid fun It has enough depth to make the hardcore happy but is easily accessible by new players The humor is definitely there This game feels like it takes whatever made castle crashers fun and woven it in wax on and wax off style The online lobby system needs more work It took me a minute last night to figure out you have to keep searching to find a game don t just let the search idle Also the game is new and not many people are playing it online yet Xbox definitely needs to advertise this game Have run into a couple glitches like where at the start of the match the game ends quickly and the host automatically wins I m assuming this will be corrected This game is a blast You owe it to yourself as a gamer to have this Oh and it has asynchronous play so you can play turn based against other Xbox players windows 8 and windows phone 8 players that s just sweet Expand 1 of 2 users found this helpful Cupcakeboy14 9 I have this on the Xbox and Windows phone and it is just plain fun The game has it s challenging moments which is a welcoming aspect to the game Also i havent tried it but it is supposed to have cross platform capabilities which sounds awesome Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful omegazelle 6 Turn based strategy given the Angry Birds treatment Simple fun with limited depth I m perplexed how other reviews claim otherwise Single utility units and single digit math If you re a fan of the genre this is a dumbed down incarnation that might provide a few hours of entertainment Strictly for novices of strategy games or light hearted fun with friends Expand 0 of 2 users found this helpful Trailers Skulls of the Shogun Launch Trailer Play Video 1 42 0 views play now Skulls of the Shogun Release Date

the best Fighting Game since Street Fighter 2 Why is it better than 3rd Strike Simple that game is great and everything but id rather kick asses with the full original cast of Characters than just having Ryu Ken Chun Li and Akuma to play with because i dont care for Alex and all the other new Shitty Characters introduced in the game so that makes Street Fighter 4 the better game Expand 0 of 0

a better game than say tekken where button mashing easily wins the day However 60 for a replica of the early 90 s is not balanced or fair to the consumers This should have been an arcade release for

new items to make even more awesome things I just wanted to keep unlocking the secrets of the game and that is why this simple yet massive game just keeps giving and giving I have barely scratched the surface and I can t wait to play some more All this publication s reviews Read full review Eurogamer ItalyMar 27 2013 90 Even with console controls Terraria is still perfectly playable and definitely one of the most enchanting indie games in recent history All this publication s reviews Read full review MondoXboxApr 7 2013 90 A Live Arcade must have an addictive unlimited 2D sandbox capable of entertaining the most creative players for many many hours All this publication s reviews Read full review InsideGamer nlApr 4 2013 80 Terraria is a game you can completely lose yourself in also on consoles The transference to controller was mostly successful and other elements like a map and a short tutorial make the game more playable It still throws you in the deep end right away though so learning how to swim might take some fishing around on the internet Whoever manages to get through the first nearly impenetrable layer awaits a deep world with expansive home made adventures All this publication s reviews Read full review Game InformerApr 18 2013 80 Terraria may not be accessible but this sandbox is so deep that you might find yourself buried in self appointed goals and chasing that carrot of upgradable gear into the early hours of the morning The combat and controls could use more polish but a nearly infinite well of items and randomly generated worlds make up for those faults A lot of games try to hold your hand through a scripted experience but Terraria makes a good argument for the merits of directionless creation All this publication s reviews Read full review

all of this the console version succeeds in being a true port and holds all of the greatness and fun that the original game did The controls are smooth although pretty different from the keyboard mouse The graphics are the same charming pixel artwork the PC version held so well and it looks like it ll be fun building back up to where I was on the PC Overall it s one of the best xbox arcade games I ve played in while and the replay value is very high for me Expand 5 of 7 users found this helpful fungifeet 10 I overall have put 72 Hours straight into Terraria since it came out on the xbox Being able to enjoy this experience with my brother has made it Ten times better The port is absolutely perfect and unlike minecraft Terraria came out with the latest update on the xbox The controls are simple and make the experience a joy Anyone that has played the pc version of Terraria will find this a fantastic port Enjoy Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful CallOfTheMoose 10 This game is still epic on xbox like it was on PC the only bad thing is lag but not so bad you break the controller i love it SO EPIC there are so many more mobs armor bosses and just way more fun Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Tommyboy55 9 This review contains spoilers click expand to view This game is very addictive I absolutely love it and my friends think ot is awesomeI would like to say i found a demon altar under my house but I m not in the corrupted zone Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Andrew4556 9 In my opinion this game is well worth the price of 1 200 Microsoft points It is very addicting to find all of the amazing items around the randomly generated worlds The bosses are quite difficult to kill alone but since it s on Xbox you can play with anyone It s so fun to explore and find something that will just make you so proud of yourself that you found it Then you can show it off to your friends The game is just so fun to play overall but the graphics are at a low level but the content in the game goes over the reason for the good graphics I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Minecraft or exploration games Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Nyxx 8 Terraria is oftentimes referred to as the 2D Minecraft and left at that While this is true it s also so much more and I feel this was why Minecraft radically changed it s game Graphics and Performance Very clean 2D visuals with virtually no slowdown except in the most extreme of circumstances The environments are very nice and detailed and react to how you interact with them appropriately The only complain I have are the animations There s hardly any on the monsters most of them may as well be still images Sound Relaxing music is a given but the sound effects are pretty good All the enemies have their own sound effects and your weapons make correct sounds too If you have a flaming greatsword you can hear the flames crackling off the blade as you swing Control Overall it s okay Jumping can be a bit annoying until you get used to it but once you get that down you ll be gathering materials and chopping down monsters like a pro Gameplay Compared to Minecraft the basics remain the same Take squares to put on top of other squares in order to build things gather materials to craft items and gear in a randomly generated world repeat ad nausium That hasn t changed What has changed is about everything else Terraria plays like an Action RPG more than a sandbox game There is a wide variety of enemies to fight treasure chests to discover containing rare items and even giant bosses to take down for rare materials and gear Unlike Minecraft where combat feels like an afterthought it was very much thought of here The amount of gear in the game is just insane Jet boots grappling hooks machine guns speed boosters meteor summoning swords just to name a few It always feels like there s always something new to find and explore It actually reminds me of an old PS2 game I liked called Dark Cloud You can build up your town and as you do you summon NPCs to live there These NPCs can heal your wounds sell you gear and items or provide helpful advice The town building aspect gives you a motivation to actually build things as opposed to build it just cause you can Not that there s a shortage of things to build All kinds of decorations and crazy things you can set up it s as diverse as the gear you can craft There are a few problems though The beginning of the game can be absolutely miserable Once you go underground you ll find yourself being murdered by enemies you stand no chance against struggling to survive with your most basic of equipment You ll fall down a horrible pit and immediately die You may run right into the Corruption right into the beginning of the game and again die What is the Corruption It s bad stuff It slowly spreads around the world bringing with it rather powerful enemies deep pits and thorns to impede your progress It is interesting how it slowly spreads throughout the world but running into it early is a death sentence This is a game you need to devote a lot of time into It s not like Minecraft where you can suddenly start building random stuff dig a bit and be like Oh I found Diamond and suddenly be godlike You need a LOT of items in order to reach that stage and this will take a lot of trial and error If you aren t willing or able to invest a lot of time in this game It takes hours just to start getting beyond the early level caves this may not be for you If you like building things which this game does well it still may not be for you Minecraft has with it wayyy more building options and of course it s in a 3D environment This makes it way better if all you want to do is build structures as you both have more to work with and more in the way of options such as crazy electronic devices However if an action packed time sink is what you re after Terraria is a good jack of all trades It does a lot of things and is a master of none of them but it s a pretty solid experience overall So much to explore and build you ll spend weeks STILL finding things about your first world that you didn t even know about yet Try before you buy but it really depends on what you like more Combat and exploration or building and exploration Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful unusualwhale 2 DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF BULL CRAP OK let me start of by saying the control scheme is TOTAL BULL buy the PC version PLEASE I dare you to get the free demo and try to build a house i DARE YOU Don t waste your money with this Just buy state of

place in Tamriel s capital province Cyrodiil You are given the task of finding the hidden heir to a throne that sits empty the previous emperor having been killed by an unknown assassin With no true Emperor the gates to Oblivion the equivalent of hell in the world of Tamriel open and demons begin to invade Cyrodiil and attack its people and towns It s up to you to find the lost heir to the throne and unravel the sinister plot that threatens to destroy all of Tamriel In keeping with the Elder Scrolls tradition players have the option to experience the main quest at their own pace and there are plenty of opportunities to explore the vast world and make your own way Numerous factions can be joined such as the thieves or mages guilds and each contains its own complete storyline and the chance to rise to the head of the faction and reap further rewards Oblivion features a groundbreaking new AI system called Radiant AI which gives non player characters NPCs the ability to make their own choices based on the world around them They decide where to eat or who to talk to and what they say They sleep go to church and even steal items all based on their individual characteristics Full

huge unlike some games there is no going over and over the same thing to try and get further on in the game It keeps going with new challenges all the time and constantly finding new places to explore

but can t wait to get back to it The initial character creation was a little cumbersome Too many ways to shift a cheek bone and not enough with adjusting body types tatoos markings etc Wasn t overly impressed with the initial dungeon sewer escape scene either But since it was designed to be a tutorial I guess I can overlook that Once I exited the sewer I was smacked right square in the face with an amazing environment to explore The draw distance detail isn t that great yada yada yada But what do you expect for a world that big The up close detail is incredible Elevations are also done quite well As you climb upward on steep terrain you do feel a sense of height One of the truly breath taking views I came across was climbing up to the top of a snowcapped mountain by horseback and overlooking the entire kingdom as the sun was setting It was truly amazing to watch the sun set behind the mountains and create that pink purple ish glow illuminating from behind the mountain range Even the clouds reflected the colors of the sunset against the black star filled sky as the final evidence of daylight disappeared for the night That scene combined with the great soundtrack playing in the background created one of those truly epic moments you ve always hoped could be achieved someday in gaming If you ve ever enjoyed playing RPGs whether hard core or casual you MUST get this game

Summary Terminal Reality s The Walking Dead video game takes the undead and brings them out of the TV show and into console gaming systems in a new terrifying way The iconic walkers will relentlessly hunt down players like their television counterparts using a combination of sight sound and smemell As Daryl players will need to tread carefully throughout each new area they explore Once discovered it doesn t take much to attract an unstoppable horde of undead walkers so every threat needs to be assessed and every situation analyzed Players will have to choose between whether to stay and fight while risking a gruesome death or using stealth to avoid the undead No place is truly safe for Daryl as he makes his way through the Georgia countryside in this new post apocalyptic world Expand

run and gun assault rifle madness and pure epicness with the crossbow at times in the game i actually thought i was daryl creeping through the dark zombie infested pharmacy shops looking for marls MEDS with Flashlight and crossbow head shotting anything that moved with turtle beaches on full high as a kite playing in the dark THE GAME WAS STRAIGHT ERIE FUN ADDICTIVE AND PORTRAYED A GREAT STORY AND MISSING LINK IN THE WALKING DEAD STORY AND CAN I POINT OUT TO ALL THE STALE TURD GAMERS OUT THERE THAT GIVE IT THIS DIRE RATING THE GRAPHICS ARE BETTER I THINK THAN BATTLE FEILD 3 WIHCH IN MY CASE

really disappoint me Expand 0 of 2 users found this helpful Dallange2point0 4 I m glad I borrowed this game instead of buying it There is some fun to be had but it gets highly repetitious very quick As far as I can tell there are only about 6 different zombie faces so get used to bashing shooting the same 6 zombies over and over My biggest complaint about this game is the auto save feature It doesn t save until you actually accomplish part of the quest or a side quest There s been a couple occasions where I had to replay 15 minutes of the game over because of the auto save There are some decent aspects of the game Deciding which survivors to take with you although I don t understand the whole having a pickup truck and only being able to choose one survivor you would think the other survivors wouldn t mind getting in the back of the truck and choosing which route to take when driving you choose back roads street or highway you don t actually drive Bottom line if you don t mind mediocre graphics and endless repetition then you may really enjoy this game Otherwise I highly recommend renting or borrowing from a friend Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful djvampyre 2 This game felt like it was headed in the right direction then some executive just stepped in and said Release it now despite the fact that it was only half done The controls are the worst example of this half baked feeling VERY clunky which is a deal breaker in a zombie game where you need fast reflexes to dispatch them in close combat Weapon swings take SO LONG it would be a death sentence to try and fight more than one zombie with just melee weapon swings even with something like a sledge hammer Bottom line melee in this game is totally broken and useless The best way to kill them is just hitting RB then side stepping behind them for an execution which is also WAY too quirky and buggy to work reliably The firearms in the game work fine nothing special but there really no point in using them because they attract every zombie on the map to your location So the best strategy ends up being to run past everything to the end which you can do on almost every map If you try and go the stealth route which is what they clearly push in the game then you can enjoy all the melee bugs and instances of them respawning zombies right behind you to add difficulty Then also enjoy all those free scratch hits zombies get while you try to melee with their awful combat system The survivors you pick up along the way are totally pointless You can send them out to scavenge but supplies are so plentiful there s never a point to doing this and it ends up being a total waste of time The last level is horrendously bad I won t spoil it for you but when you finish off the game you will realize just how bad and half baked this game was I would have loved to see what they could have done with more time and money A better scavenging survivor system and a much more fluid melee combat system would have propelled this game into the good category for sure Sad to see this get rushed out Expand 8 of 11 users found this helpful BudHarvest 0 The only thing going for the game is the voice over

visceral origin story of this character In the game Lara Croft ascends from a frightened young lady on her first adventure and emerges as a hardened survivor With only her sharp instincts and her innate ability to push the limits of human endurance Lara must fight explore and use her intelligence to unravel the dark history of a forgotten island and escape its tight grip Expand Developer

MagazineMar 22 2013 100 Early quick time events aside this twelve hour adventure suffers so few missteps that it s a genuine delight to play even as the lead gets trampled into the seasoned pro we ve come to know Everyone take a bow the first lady of gaming has returned All this publication s reviews Read full review 3DJuegosFeb 25 2013 94 Tomb Raider is an extraordinary video game Its gameplay is amusing Lara s animations are stunning and the game is one hell of a ride All this publication s reviews Read full review X360 Magazine UKMar 30 2013 90 A near flawless example of how to reboot a franchise Gripping satisfying and strangely dark we struggle to see how this origin story could have been told much better May 2013 p 77 All this publication s reviews MondoXboxMar 2 2013 87 Tomb Raider s reboot is definitely a success delivering a deep adrenalinic and spectacular game with a new and charismatic Lara Croft Our main complaint is with the lack of greater scale puzzles and more challenging ones something the game should have retained from its predecessors All this publication s reviews Read full review GameplanetFeb 25 2013 85 Lara s return is a triumphant one providing gamers with a visually breathtaking adventure around a well realised island setting that harbours some dark secrets Some more challenging puzzles and platforming would have been welcome but as it stands Tomb Raider is a thrilling reboot of a legendary franchise All this publication s reviews Read full review Toronto SunMar 6 2013 80 It s a fine return to form for the heroine whose comically conical boobs once fuelled a thousand adolescent quests for mythical nude codes Lara Croft s a real girl now with real motivations fears and feelings And this is one reboot we hope will stick All this publication s reviews Read full review MachinimaFeb 25 2013 60 It s really hard to be excited about the future of Tomb Raider after this game It fails where more successful films and games of its kind succeed in its characters The way in which Lara goes from inexperienced to full on action movie hero survivalist is so jarring that it s near impossible as a player to remain on the same emotional wavelength as the story Because of this the rest of the game falters All this publication s reviews Read full review See all 70 Critic Reviews User Reviews Write a Review Score distribution Positive

challenging And finally the story its pretty good most of the time I can assure u this will be one of the best of games of 2013 Expand 26 of 36 users found this helpful MikeE50 10 10 10 Excellent and fun game No spoiler review practically every element of this game is fun exploring the physics puzzles and I usually dislike game puzzles shooting climbing etc If you like Uncharted but find it clunky you will love Tomb Raider because the gameplay is fun The visuals and sound design are also excellent There are many memorable moments of gameplay the kind that make we want to replay a game every few years like I do with the Mass Effect series The only downsides the story could have been better and some of the voice acting is flat but they have few lines Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful zeone222 10 It is a very good game with likable characters in game like sam or new tomb I have console version and pc if you have nvidia card mine is 550 ti you can get high settings and good frame rate when turning of tessellation high precise normal for ssao and depth of field Overal you should buy Tomb raider on both platform Expand 3 of 5 users found this helpful SchroederRock 9 Having barely played Tomb Raider games in the past I was very interested to see a reboot of the franchise that runs an origin story This made it easy for me to decide to jump in and play an entire game to the end and see how it turned out This Tomb Raider which takes several cues from the best games of today is absolutely fantastic Easily one of the most cinematic titles I ve ever played The camera angles and treacherous environments all give a bit of a white knuckle experience that I find more and more rare in games these days I haven t embraced the multiplayer yet but I bought this game for the story line and the single player experience I am very happy I did and look forward to what this franchise has to offer going forward Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful DiRTY8SUPER 9 I went into this game not knowing what to expect Tomb Raider game mechanics have been stale since the PS2 version How refreshing this reboot is It looks gorgeous as does Lara and plays equally as good It doesn t hit the heights of the Uncharted series but comes close Overall this is a great reboot and I look forward to Tomb Raider 2 on next gen Expand 2 of 4 users found this helpful M9ki 8 This was a good game I liked it but I was bored after a while I wish there was more to do in it This is a should buy game its perfect for any gamer to play Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful MaggotBrain666 0 Too easy waaaaay to easy This hole game almost just felt like a level 1 or the tutorial level from any of the old TR games 6 hours total with hand holding all the way through is a JOKE And whats up with the camera angles and wardrobe Where it set and made by religigious fanatics I really dont want to see Lara with a 1930s adventurer bomber jacket case closed And yeah the graphics kinda sucks too it tries to fool you and make you think that it s good but suddenly all the caves looks the same and as in Far Blurr 3 this suffer from the same poor writing distance I bet this can run well on an ipad in relativly short time and thats not an overstatementt Sad to see that Lara is gone cause this simply isnt a TR game Expand 1 of 24 users found this helpful See all 252 User Reviews Trailers

the horror of a serial murderer loose on the streets of Manhattan detectives Joseph and Michael race against time to catch the killer The crime scenes and the way each victim was killed lead the detectives to theorize that each of the killings may be linked to the victims ancient namesakes Those namesakes are known to be some of the most saintly people that have graced the earth As evidence continues to mount and more body bags are gathered the detectives are convinced that the killer is basing his crimes on the belief that every generation has 36 righteous individuals who live among us where with all of them gone the world would fall into chaos corruption and eventual darkness The hunt is on to find the last of the 36 Saints before the killer does Active Fox Productions Expand

Shot always maintains a firm grip on its sad deteriorating environment All this critic s reviews Read full review Village VoiceReviewed by Alan ScherstuhlSep 17 2013 80 David M Rosenthal s sturdy nasty rural noir based on Matthew F Jones s novel is so sharp and rusted through that after taking it in you ll likely need a tetanus shot All this critic s reviews Read full review Arizona RepublicReviewed by Bill GoodykoontzSep 19 2013 70 A Single Shot never rises to the level of a great film like Winter s Bone which digs much deeper in its depiction of life in the hills among the desperate poor But thanks largely to Rockwell it s not bad either All this critic s reviews Read full review NPRReviewed by Tomas HachardSep 20 2013 55 By the end Macy s presence is just one part of what makes A Single Shot recall the Coen brothers Fargo That film s now famous wood chipper scene can seem strangely tame a decade and a half on but it still has a lesson to teach When you show violence in a story that s not really about violence there d better be more of a point than just making us squirm All this publication s reviews Read full review Boston GlobeReviewed by Peter KeoughSep 19 2013 50 In lieu of suspense Rosenthal relies on a mood of free floating anxiety enhanced by West Virginia actually British Columbia landscapes where the sun never shines As one note as

searching dialogue with deer in the headlights stoicism We ve crossed a line Lil blankly notes doesn t help matters All this critic s reviews Read full review The DissolveReviewed by Mike D AngeloSep 4 2013 40 Given the level of sophistication at which the movie operates they might as well have called it Motherlover after the Lonely Island video in which Andy Samberg and Justin Timberlake sing about the exact same taboo foursome The only significant difference is that the comedy in Motherlover is fully intentional All this critic s reviews Read full review Washington PostReviewed by Ann

literally and at a stultifying pace in a story that might have worked onscreen as either heightened melodrama or farcical comedy Instead Fontaine who is not exactly blessed with a light touch opts for misplaced sincerity All this critic s reviews Read full review New York Daily NewsReviewed by Joe NeumaierSep 5 2013 20 Though Fontaine makes sure the beaches are sun dappled and the women s shared

and the photography and score are impressive It is intriguing but at the same time quite frivolous Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful csw12 4 Adore manages to be many things like creepy ludicrous swallow but nothing can describe it better as a humorless boring melodrama in an isolated setting with nothing that inspires or intrigues Nothing to see here besides the beautiful scenery Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful GreatMartin 2 The first thing the movie Adore makes you want to do is book a flight to Seals Rock New South Wales Australia to see the blue drenched wad waters green mountains and hills sun baked beaches and homes to die for a Paradise on earth and the film does a good job of advertising the place and the surroundings Lil Naomi Watts and Roz Robin Wright have been best friends from childhood and still are after each has been married with Lil now a widow and Roz s husband Harold Ben Mendelsohn taking a job in Sidney expecting the family to join him Lil has a son Ian Xavier Samuel and Roz a son Tom James Frecheville both at the end of their teens ready to take their place in the world In the sensual surroundings they live in it is not long before each mother is having an affair with the other s son Based on a short story by Doris Lessing and a screenplay written by Christopher Hampton the latter doesn t know quite how to get into the story and the director Anne Fontaine seems afraid to tell a 2013 story instead making it a film that Todd Haynes would have told in the 1990s or Douglas Sirk in the 1950s both who would have gone deeper into the ramifications While there is no darkness in the film neither is there a light touch that could have made it more meaningful We have come a long way from The Graduate and Mrs Robinson but Adore is stuck in that era The supporting players such as Mendelson a potential suitor her own age for Lil Gary Sweet and girlfriends for both boys played by Jessica Tovey and Sophie Lowe work hard but the writer and director don t seem to take the circumstances seriously and the shock value is almost nil It is stuck between the possibility of farce and how lives would be affected by the adults decisions Watts Wright Samuel and Frecheville offer a lot of eye candy for both sexes and do the best they can with the material they are given The film moves too slowly at points and should have been cut by 10 15 minutes but the work of the cinematographer Christophe Beaucarne is worth the price of admission The city of Seal Rocks should give him surfing rights for his lifetime Expand 0 of 0 users

Score distribution Positive 1 out of 1 Mixed 0 out of 1 Negative 0 out of 1 MarcDoyle 8 Kathryn Hahn is a force of nature she s the comedic and dramatic backbone of this movie and she s truly incredible in it On the other hand the producers dropped the ball by casting Josh Radnor as her husband He doesn t have the chops to share the screen with her I was pleasantly surprised by Juno Temple though the writers did give her a bit of the short shrift toward the end of the film The rest of the female supporting cast is decent with the exception of the always excellent Michaela Watkins but again it ultimately comes down to Hahn She s simply a pleasure to watch in this film Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful var nr domain www metacritic com var nrelate dwparams mapp nrelate comptype

magnetic performances by Rooney Mara and Casey Affleck as Bonnie and Clyde doomed lovers Ain t Them Bodies Saints is a tragic but not despairing tale of fatal romance set in the Texas hill country in the mid 1970s It marks the arrival of an immense talent who will be new to most moviegoers although Lowery is a well known figure in the indie film world and it s surely one of the best American films of the year All this critic s reviews Read full review The DissolveReviewed by Keith PhippsAug 15 2013 90 While virtually every shot looks like a work of art much of the beauty of Ain t Them Bodies Saints comes from Lowery s refusal to choose sides All this critic s reviews Read full review Time Out LondonReviewed by Cath ClarkeSep 4 2013 80 Bodies gets under your skin and stays there And the

beautiful new film his most ambitious to date is at first glance a standard love story set in the American West of what appears to be the early 1970s Over time however Ain t Them Bodies Saints transcends its plot revealing itself as a cinematic meditation on the daunting power of loneliness All this publication s reviews Read full review Chicago TribuneReviewed by Michael PhillipsAug 29 2013 75 Since he popped up and broke hearts in Altman s McCabe and Mrs Miller Carradine has learned a wealth of practical acting knowledge about how much and how little need be done at any given

Review Score distribution Positive 3 out of 4 Mixed 1 out of 4 Negative 0 out of 4 MarcDoyle 9 One of the best movies I ve seen in the last couple of years Beautifully shot and tremendous acting performances by the four leads Mara Affleck Carradine and Foster It s great to finally see Ben Foster in this kind of sympathetic virtuous role after so many years of playing the unbalanced dangerous outsider I also have to mention the score which was perfect in tying the movie together especially as the tension rises toward the climax Lastly Nate Parker does an amazing job in a supporting role we need to see more of him on the big screen Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful foxgrove 8 Beautifully photographed and superbly acted Casey Affleck proves once again that he is the better actor than brother Ben in a performance that is second only to his coward Robert Ford For the first time I have taken note of Rooney Mara and I honestly don t think Keith Carradine and Ben Foster have ever been better The star of this film however is the lyrical writing which the actors bring to life exquisitely The combination of the two makes many scenes totally hypnotic There is also a pervading sense of tragedy throughout which is underlined by the perfect and appropriately mournful score The abrupt ending slightly disappoints but this is actually due more to my expectation than to do with the story not concluding It could have gone on but that is another story and in effect would make this a different film Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Thegodfatherson 6 David Lowery is the equivalent of a Terrence Malick cover band He has all the rhythms and notes but none of the heart and soul He s sellingng nostalgia at the expense of originality And for some that might be just enough But for me sitting through his aesthetically beguiling faux Western Ain t Them Bodies Saints merely left me craving an umpteenth look at Badlands and Days of Heaven Malick films Lowery obviously suckled as intently as his mama s breast He does a superb job at paraphrasing both from the hazy dreamlike visuals to the long pauses and dialogue so muted that you often feel like you re eavesdropping on a conversation in the next room The characters are pure Malick too Young lovers doomed by restlessness and ennui running from the law as intently as they re trying to flee from their consciences And just like Heaven a love triangle with an ethereal woman conflicted by her romantic feelings for a good man and his evil boy rival Just replace Brooke Adams with Rooney Mara Sam Shepard with Ben Foster and Richard Gere with Casey Affleck Or if you prefer the Badlands motif swap out Mara for Sissy Spacek and Affleck for Martin Sheen Either way you come up short It s not that their performances are bad it s that these consistently fine actors are curiously miscast beginning with Affleck who s too soft spoken and non threatening to be taken seriously as a hardened criminal That s more Foster s purview as he proved so indelibly on Six Feet Under and in 310 to Yuma As a heroic big hearted deputy he s just not cutting it As for Mara I feared that she might fall asleep at any minute She certainly doesn t communicate what it is that drives Affleck s Bob and Foster s Will to chase after her Ruth so intently It s not that their performances are bad it s that these consistently fine actors are curiously miscast beginning with Affleck who s too soft spoken and non threatening to be taken seriously as a hardened criminal That s more Foster s purview as he proved so indelibly on Six Feet Under and in 310 to Yuma As a heroic big hearted deputy he s just not cutting it As for Mara I feared that she might fall asleep at any minute She certainly doesn t communicate what it is that drives Affleck s Bob and Foster s Will to chase after her Ruth so intently As for the plot there really isn t one beyond Bob breaking out of prison off camera no doubt due to the expense of shooting such a scene and taking it on the lam in search of his beloved Ruth and their soon to be 4 year old daughter Sylvie whom he has never met Standing in his way are three squinty eyed bounty hunters Ruth s father figure neighbor Keith Carradine doing his best work in years and a host of sheriff s deputies including Will who persistently attempts to insinuate himself into the lives of Ruth and her daughter Beyond that nothing much happens But given Lowery s passion for Malick esque visuals it s hardly a shock that his script is so bare boned and derivative Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful TVJerry 5 The story starts with Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara in deep love and expecting a child Almost immediately he ends up in jail then escapes several years later to return to his family During it all a cop Ben Foster pursues them both in different ways To make such a simple narrative work takes good writing performances and direction Unfortunately none of those are especially commendable here To make matters worse the pacing is too slow and the cinematography is moody but flat While this simple tragedy had potential to be involving nothing about the production helped Expand 0 of 0

Alan ScherstuhlAug 13 2013 80 The ending is a bit of an audience pleasing cop out a retreat into formula after 80 minutes or so of upending it But those upendings are memorable the cast dishy fun and

WloszczynaAug 16 2013 63 All this sounds eminently promising But it would need a wordsmith as witty and wise as Emma Thompson who won an Oscar for adapting the big screen version of 1995 s Sense and

author s world While playing an Austen heroine she meets two men both handsome and two other participants Jennifer Coolidge Georgia King who are both over the top but still funny There s a rollicking energy that keeps this film entertaining despite the fact that most of the comedy isn t that clever Entirely predictable but fun Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful GreatMartin 2 It is very seldom I have seen a bad performance by an actor in a film was what I wrote in a previous review this past week and then today thy that very seldom reared its head in Austenland where there are 2 I hope purposely bad and 3 just plain bad performances The latter are by actresses who will remain nameless as I don t think they will put this film on their resume and not many will see them Keri Russell gives a lively performance as Jane who has come to find her Darcy here called Henry Nobley and played by JJ Feild in an assured performance in Austenland sort of a full Jane Austen resort His rival Martin Bret McKenzie seems to have wandered in from D H Lawrence s Lady Chatterley s Lover as the masculine caretaker Talk about masculine enter Navy very hard body stud Captain George East Ricky Whittle who deservedly takes off his shirt at any opportunity or just having the camera on him The screenplay by the director Jerusha Hess and Shannon Hale who also wrote the chick lit bestseller of the same name is all over the place being neither a homage to Jane Austen a romance comedy or even sticking to the fantasyland idea intruding with a modern soundtrack The bottom line is that if you have never read Jane Austen s Pride and Prejudice or one of her other novels you would be better off reading them or if you have read any of her books reread them and stay away from this movie It is not a bad movie even though it has some embarrassing performances but it does not deliver on the major premise Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful var nr domain www metacritic com var nrelate

movie genre I love Josh Holloway from Lost but who in the hell did they sign him up in the movie This is a Step Up rip off If anybody that could teach incredible moves like this it would have to be Michael Jackson Bottom Line Save it for the Razzies because this film is a dud Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful MarkDetrel 0 Battle of the Year is one of the most horrible movies of this year is like a terrible spin off of the Step Up saga This movie has good coreographies but the rest of the movie development screenplay performances etc is extremely bad Expand 3 of 4 users found this helpful Thegodfatherson 0 As a whole though there s not nearly enough quality material to make Battle of the Year recommendable much less accessible to anyone otheher than the most hard core of dance fanatics and even they may want to think twice about seeing the movie in theaters Everyone else this is just potential future home viewing material for a drinking game take a shot every time a dancer points and oohs at his opponent or Josh Holloway gives a pep talk or when there s an unnecessary reaction shot featuring Chris Brown Expand 3 of 4 users found this helpful Movie1997 0 I don t have anything

doubt about about that but Inarritu s genius is it s ability to captivate to grab on and not let go and to make you feel every moment of pain desperation The cast is flawless and Bardem is without a doubt the single greatest actor that Spain has produced Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful DrTathata 10 It was St Paul who claimed that the good that he would was not what he did but the evil that he wouldn t In a way that true statement of the potential for error in the best of our intentions is the strange attractor that drives this beautiful exquisitely painful story Put yourself in the man Uxbal s shoes and ask yourself what would it feel like to be intricately enmeshed such a complex web and yet have so few moves available with which to solve your problem The Universe will take care of your children he is told and although it may be true it is cold comfort for any dying parent whose last thoughts cluster around the question what will become of them without my love and care With all of his dying preoccupations rolled into one overwhelming question the one person in his life capable of attending to his children when he is gone stands gazing at the flight departure list her baby on her back and every penny he owned in her bag what will she do and why does she do it What is it that drives the choice that she makes Is it love Is it duty What does she owe this man And why would she choose to deny everything she had longed for Difficult questions often without answers abound This is a thought provoking film true and unflinchingly real in it s study of the characters involved For the world as we find it is not black and white but infinite shades of light and dark and it is rare that anyone is wholly good or wholly bad or even wholly unsympathetic And don t think you can always predict what someone will do before they are put to the test Depending on the perspective of the others in our lives we are each of us both heros and villains in one way or another In the final analysis nobody gets out alive You can t take it with you All roads end in the grave Life is a lesson about loss and all striving is futile The lucky ones who fight against the dying of the light think of those they love as their cares drop one by one from their cold dead fingers Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful mperezsimons 9 Mexican director Alejandro Gonz lez I rritu is known for his signature multi protagonist plots introduced in his death trilogy which included Amores Perros 21 Grams and Babel In Biutiful however he zooms in on one character Uxbal a single father from Barcelona facing terminal cancer Uxbal is a fascinating character with many good intentions that don t always translate into good deeds While he truly cares for people his brother even calls him the Dalai Lama he actually makes a living from an operation where illegal Senegalese immigrants sell on the streets the counterfeited bags and pirated CDs produced in a sweatshop by a group of frightened Chinese who sleep on the floor of a locked basement So yes Uxbal is a complicated hero not perfect by any means but because of Bardem s earnest performance you feel Uxbal s pain and he also wins you over with the love he so tenderly expresses for his soon to be fatherless children and for the father he never met And that s what the movie is truly about parenthood how people no matter their nationality are always concerned with giving their kids a better life You ll find that most of the characters from Uxbal to the police officer to the sweatshop owner to the main Senegalese immigrant are trying to do what s best for their kids But are their choices moral or even legal Morality is a big theme here and the movie will leave you questioning even your own To appreciate this film you need to understand I rritu s style bold and bleak and confrontational He wants to shock you make you angry remove you from your comfortable place so you can experience some of the realities millions of people face everyday Allow him to Biutiful is worth watching because of the many layers of the story the stellar performances by Javier Bardem and Maricel Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful nutterjr 7 Tackling immigration and the associated social implications this film is great because the lead actor Bardem is one of the best actors alive and Inarritu keeps making really biutiful movies Expand 0

that s just showing off Outside of Lars Von Trier s Antichrist it s not every movie which dares to feature graphic and in this case gratuitous urination Willem Dafoe pisses blood just once Since Biutiful is ultimately a horror movie in two senses it s interesting how this visceral grotesquerie corresponds to the non genre side of the categorical divide Not only does Uxbal Javier Bardem piss a weak arcing stream of dark brown liquid he also pisses in his pants Cancer s effects has left him incontinent Very soon the low level criminal will be needing to wear extra protection Needless to say the filmmaker shows Bardem in a diaper because that s how miserabilists like him roll The filmmaker challenges Bardem to find the dignity in his indignity The filmmaker makes sure that his audience feels something for this dying man leaving no stone unturned for this father of two children a boy and a girl whom he exploits unmercifully as a point of manipulation for the movie s life and death matters He banks on the great reservoirs of feelings that most moviegoers possess for the death affected young To the miserabilist an emotion like joy can only be applied fleetingly and ironically as a temporal reprieve from a permeated mis en scene of unremitting fatalism the film s prevailing diegetic expression thus when resumed right about the time Ana blows out her celebratory candle will turn out to be all the more devastating this resignation of hope just like how the filmmaker planned it He wants to take all the wind out of our sails He knows and we know that Ana s eleventh birthday is going to be her last happy one for awhile Because the fix is in where nothing positive can arise from these tragic circumstances due to the filmmaker s aesthetics Marambra Marciel Alvarez Uxbel s ex wife we know will continue to struggle with her bipolar condition even though Uxbel is counting on her to be a full time mother From the very start we know she s out of the running for full custody of Ana and Pedro For the most part the filmmaker sets her up to be a misfit parent The screenplay never allows for a scene where Uxbel informs this cocaine addled woman about his disease Oblivious to Uxbel s bloody pee Marambara isn t given a fair shake in the redemption department If she knew the whole story maybe the bad mother would have the impetus to change While his condition gets worse and worse the film invites you to hate Marambra who is predisposed towards inter family infidelities and child abuse dealbreakers both but entirely avoidable had full disclosure been practiced With nowhere else to turn the de factor orphans are entrusted to an almost complete stranger In the tradition of noble self sacrificing black women Ige Diaryatu Daff a Senegalese woman whom Uxbel knows only by association is supposed to jump at the chance to look after a white man s children but she subverts this cliched attitude toward non white females which has the effect of complimenting the one man United Nations for his colorblindness by returning to Africa with the money originally allocated for her charges welfare Is it the filmmaker s intentions to associate Ige with the story that Tito tells Uxbel about the supposedly loyal tiger who bites the face of its trusting owner Is Biutiful that unfair Because Uxbel is such a nice guy we lose sight of the fact that he s a profiteer complicit to the exploitation which leads to the sweatshop gassing and the sidewalk vendors Ige s husband included being deported back home In reality Ige owes him nothing Last seen at the airport for a split second we think that Ige had changed her mind but the voice we hear back at the dark apartment is of Uxbel s own making For a split second we think Uxbel will die with peace of mind knowing that his children will be taken care of But alas a relatively happy ending is not in the filmmaker s vocabulary Uxbel dies with his children s welfare unresolved As aforementioned Biutiful is a horror movie Not in the genre sense where Uxbel has the sixth sense and can see dead people but rather it s the horror of watching a man die slow and hard Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful cinemaquote 5 How can talents such as I arritu and Del Toro plus Bardem s breathtaking performance amount to such a painful experience for the viewer Someone described this as 3 bad movies in 1 I cannot say that much yet I strongly urge I arritu to reflect on what grasped us in Amores Perros or even Babel and make movies for us not only for his viewing pleasure Bring on the magic cinemaquote Expand 3 of 3 users

year the story is really interesting the development is great the script is awesome the performances are amazing Excellent movie Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Nesbitt10 8 Ominous and tense throughout Blue Caprice is a slow burn that builds to an unsettling boil leaving you with a known outcome that s hard to digest Director Alexandre Moors crafts a deceptively eerie depiction of Lee Malvo and John Allen Muhammad and to its credit the movie never pretends to have the answer Moors stunning debut captures a horrific and confining tone of the tragic three weeks in October of 2002 when ten people were assassinated in a random series of attacks spanning across Washington DC Maryland and Virginia Blue Caprice features two fantastic performances from Isaiah Washington and Tequan Richmond portraying the Beltway Snipers John Allen Muhammad and Lee Malvo The movie begins on the Caribbean Island of Antigua where life is not easy for a young Lee Malvo Tequan Richmond who is left to fend for himself after his mother abandons him once again Muhammad spots Lee who appears as if he is drowning rescues him and becomes an adoptive father figure Moors uses Lee Malvo as the audience s entry point into Muhammad s world and John s back story comes only in pieces However it doesn t take much to surmise that Muhammad is trouble Flash forward a few months and Muhammad has successfully smuggled Malvo into the United States returning to Washington where they stay with John s old friend Ray Tim Blake Nelson and his wife Jamie Joey Lauren Adams When Ray introduces Malvo to his gun collection to blow off steam both men recognize the raw talent Lee possesses Muhammad then begins to mold Malvo into a mindless assassin eliminating any shred morality that may still lie within This bond between the two progressively develops into a powerful warped father son style relationship As the blind loyalty grows we learn of John s grandiose scheme to create widespread mayhem and terror starting with random killings following no discernible pattern Moors directorial approach is consistent throughout using restraint and creating distance from the actual assassination scenes For example he presents the reactions of Malvo shooting his weapon rather than what is happening at the other end of the gun A victim is only seen briefly as their body falls to the ground while the Caprice slowly glides away Moors creates a disturbing portrait of two ruthless men in free fall and Isaiah Washington and Tequan Richmond both do outstanding work here Washington has the extraordinarily difficult task of methodically revealing John s inner rage resentments and hatred that simmers just beneath his calm exterior He s both ferociously charismatic as well as deeply unsettling Even more so impressive is the performance of Tequan Richmond who must convey emotions or lack thereof in a character who rarely speaks of feelings at all It s the sense of not knowing that makes his marvelous performance so chilling The film owes a lot to its excellent cast as well as the cinematography and a sharp minimalistic screenplay by R F I Porto What makes the film so exceptional is that it doesn t attempt to recreate and instead reconstructs the story from the inside out This was a distorted horrific mission carried out through manipulation and the escalation of evil Blue Caprice generates an innermost sense of riding in the backseat with these two only to leave you with introspection and muddled thoughts that linger long after the viewing Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful theseparator 7 In 2002 ten people were randomly assassinated in the Washington D C area by a duo called the Beltway Snipers Blue Caprice a film by Alexadre Moors investigates these events The film opens with the lush blues and greens of tropical Antigua but to the young protagonist Lee Malvo Tequin Richmond having just been abandoned by his mother this island paradise has become a prison Just in time Lee is saved by John a caring neighbor played Isaiah Washington The pair soon depart Antigua for the US Lee as John s adopted son Fast forward a few months to Tacoma Washington John s pathological personality has begun to emerge Father and son drift from couch to couch John s other kids have been taken away by their mother a restraining order officially filed Enter firearms and John s maniacal attempt to transform Lee into an automaton assassin begins John locates his ex wife and kids in Maryland Out for blood John and Lee head east in a blue 1990 Chevy Caprice what will become the epicenter for their killing spree When they reach the Eastern US John s psychopathology is unleashed and Lee is forced to help avenge a fictitious eternal grudge Director Moors shows us that Lee is undoubtedly a bright kid He memorizes his combat manual in detail and applies the instruction with expert precision Had he been a year older Lee may have applied these mercenary skills in the Army We sense Lee feels remorse and does not want to become a hardened senseless killer In a touching scene Lee steals of all things veggie burgers Post Boston Marathon bombings this film resonates strongly of the psychologically excruciating manipulation of the underling by the elder After the Tsarnev brothers we why not keep this dialogue open Or should we wait until after another docum drama shows us the horrors or another atrocity occurs Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful netflic 7 This is an attempt to paint a psychological portrait of infamous Beltway snipers who killed 10 people in 2002 and terrorized Washington D C area for two weeks I am not sure if the authors were successful to answer the question Why did they do it There are many people angry at the world some of them are trained to kill whether by State or by themselves some of them are deranged to different degrees but they do not become what these two did This couple is not shown as simple evil doers A man rescues a stranger a vulnerable teenage boy from a suicide attempt He stands up to become a fatherly figure for the boy builds up his character teaches his things only to exploit him later as a killer or innocent people No gun laws can protect a society from such people as these or Unabomber or other mass killers Overall the movie is very well made the script performance and cinematography

refreshing change from your over the top absurd dramas Closed Circuit was Gripping Conceivable required the audience to actually think featured a constantly and subtly twisting plot and had a firm foundation in the world we live in and how far people in positions of power will go When I came home after watching it I actually expected to see a news story about the British Justice system Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful BHBarry 8 Closed Circuit stars Eric Bana Rebecca Hall and Jim Broadbent in this British courtroom drama involving terrorism Britain s MI 5 and a hod a horrendous crime that is the subject of the film Well written by Steven Knight Eastern Promises Dirty Pretty Things and ably directed by John Crowley this film will keep the viewer on the edge of the theater seat from the very first frame as the story unwinds into the intricacies of espionage terrorism and the legal system under which all of the parties are operating One of the more positive things about this film is that although the plot is complicated and extremely involved excellent writing and editing help make the most difficult of legal concepts and problems easy to understand and follow This is no small task to accomplish given the intricacies and rules of law being applied I give this film an 8 for above average acting writing editing and directing all of which make for a very exciting theatrical experience Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful MarcDoyle 8 I can t for the life of me figure out why this movie rated to poorly with so many professional critics I m seeing that some think the leads have no chemistry I don t buy that at all I think their chemistry is palpable I also heard the plot would be tough to follow similar to Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy Not even close Absolutely accessible and thrilling Recommended Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful TVJerry 6 With a title like this you d expect closed circuit TV would play strongly in the narrative and you d be wrong The title could have been Pararanoia but that movie s already in town Eric Bana and Rebecca Hall play the attorneys for a man who s been accused of a terrorist bombing in London but there s more to his defense that it seems Unfortunately it s nothing we haven t seen before While it s interesting to watch it unfold and the performances are good the suspense is not existent Adding a few angles shot from surveillance cameras doesn t make it original enough to be memorable Expand 2 of 2 users found this helpful Movie1997 5 There were some things I liked about this movies and there were others that I didn t like but in the end it s satisfying to but never attempts to amaze Be sure to check out my YouTube channel TheMovieManLife for all things movies Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful poetreviewer 5 This movie is boring dumb and poorly acted There is no chemistry between Hall and Bana when there is supposed to be a lot Nothing in this movie makes sense including why it was ever made It s a no go Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Thegodfatherson 5 Moviegoers looking for a moody political drama will find Closed Circuit provides some engaging character beats and interesting albeit not exceptionally deep thoughts on government oversight Strong performances from Bana and Hall help elevate Crowley s film above similarly predictable thrillers and it s hard not to admire the director for some risky choices in both the story and the actual filmmaking That said plot holes as well as underdeveloped characters undercut the power of the final film and many moviegoers who are attracted to the thought provoking political thriller genre will as a result find Closed Circuit is too divided between creativity and commentary to be particularly exciting or insightful Expand 1 of 2 users found this helpful See all 10 User Reviews var nr domain www metacritic com var nrelate dwparams mapp nrelate comptype widget comp 380 riaevent view s6 document location

found this helpful MarkDetrel 9 Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 maybe is one of the most ridiculous and exaggerated ideas of this year but don t care is an extremely funny sequel with a cool animation much funny moments I could no ask for anything more Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 is one of my favorite movies of this year Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful RevRon 9 I love the first movie it became my favorite animated movie of all time and I found I really enjoyed this one too Once again the movie is just plain fun The animation looks fantastic the food animals are creative and amusing the voice acting is great and like the first one it s just hysterical While I didn t think it was as gut busting as the first one I still laughed a lot and I really want to add this to my repeat viewing list come on Blu Ray release date hurry up and get here However the one thing that I loved the most had to have been the background designs The way they created the landscapes into food based locations was very creative and pretty cool to witness Overall it s a decent and fun follow up to a epic first film Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful HeatSeeker 7 Being a fan of the first Cloudy I was excited to check out the sequel While the original is better mostly because it has more heart there s lots to keep adults and kids entertained here It starts off a bit slow giving a short review of what happened in the first film for those who didn t watch it which was definitely thoughtful but once the story unfolds it pulls the viewer in It s not a spectacular story the twists are pretty predictable but it has a good flow and there are no dull moments Sony did a fantastic job with the visuals very colorful vibrant and the living food really come to life Humor was in good supply and the food related puns were actually quite clever My only real problems with the movie were the somewhat lacking story line and the protagonist Flint who didn t seem nearly as endearing as I remember him from the first movie They made him too wacky and all over the place and it s hard to imagine kids relating to him or remembering him as a character they d like to emulate Still Cloudy 2 will keep you entertained enough and it s worth watching it at least once especially if you craved more after watching the original Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful JohnnLee 6 It s a good and funny film for the kids but the jokes are really not that funny at all The story went smooth through the first half of the film but then it kind of just went down hill from there The first Cloudy was funny and had a lot of creative ideas pitch in there however I felt like the squeal was to predicable and the scenes just went too fast I felt like they could ve done better with the music and whatnot but the kids well absolutely enjoy it I m ranking this a 6 9 or a D Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Papason 6 I couldn t really think of a plot to add to the first movie and apparently neither could the writers I absolutely loved the first movie so I was destined for disappointment All of the story lines had been resolved and the world was safe again from food Little did we know that Jurassic Park had been resurrected Actually one of the best scenes recreates the first time in that original movie that we see the reanimated dinosaurs Only this time they are animated and made of food What a total ripoff That is another movie series that should never have gone on Of course in Hollywood if something works then you need to keep doing it until you get it wrong Flints relationships with his not really girlfriend deteriorates to the point of co worker and the father son turns more into man and his dog There are some fabulous scenes and humor as well but not enough meat on the bone even for our seven year old After 20 minutes the kids were bored and the adults just wished it wouldn t degrade into potty humor It did and that was unfortunately the only real laughs the rest of the way The morals and lessons weren t too bad except they were just rehashed from the first movie and rather than expanded more like contracted The funny food animals and especially their combined names were a bright spot in an overwhelmingly dull afternoon Please do not make a number 3 We all know what happens to leftovers the second reheating Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Movie1997 5 While it s not as bad as some might expect it s no where close to the first movie Overall did they really need to make a sequel plus this movie is more for kids than

Sadaris Naked is funnier than viewing this film adaptation but this movie holds its own very well as a gripping coming of age story From the beginning the story flows well and is understandable There are moments of intense touching feelings for Samuel David s taken on name as he expands his experiences after graduate school by picking apples at a small Oregon farm and then in a factory His struggles as a gay man in a very straight and often homophobic culture are readily apparent and very moving especially in the last scene as he is betrayed and then rejected by a would be Christian rescuer who has obvious problems This film is worth seeing Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful var nr domain www metacritic com var nrelate dwparams mapp nrelate comptype widget comp 380 riaevent

I watched this on Demand today I personally love IFC it brings simplicity back to the scene the writing I thought was brilliantly subdued but was able to allow for a unique juvenile building of fear and excitement for what may lie around the next snow covered bend on the Mountain I am retired army I have been to the Urals my father in Antarctica I have also been in the Carpathians in Transylvania I thought was such a twist you really have to be interested in conspiracy theories or interested in per 1960 science I do not want to ruin this film for anybody But lets say I wants you to believe

Starring Brie Larson Glenne Headly Italia Ricci Jeremy Luke Joseph Gordon Levitt Julianne Moore Lindsey Broad Rob Brown Scarlett Johansson Tony Danza Summary Jon Martello objectifies everything in his life his apartment his car his family his church and of course women His buddies even call him Don Jon because of his ability to pull 10s every weekend without fail Yet even the finest flings don t compare to the transcendent bliss he achhe achieves alone in front of the computer watching pornography Dissatisfied he embarks on a journey to find a more gratifying sex life but ends up learning larger lessons of life and love through relationships with two very different women Expand Director Joseph Gordon Levitt Genre s Drama Comedy Rating R Runtime 90 min More Details and Credits Critic

Thegodfatherson 10 In the end Gordon Levitt offers something that is funny witty honest and eventually heartfelt without having to pander to the saccharine fantasies or gross out raunch humor that have become the two main lanes of rom com cinema This is a date movie whose boldness edge and careful handling of some volatile material truly makes it balanced and engaging to both sides of the gender spectrum By the time the credits roll you won t just leave the theater feeling entertained you ll leave with something to talk about And for a first timer crafting a film that gets people talking is quite an accomplishment Expand 3 of 6 users found this helpful StevieB212 10 Great fun A romantic comedy with a serious lesson Fine performances all around Slick to watch Moves fast No immaturity in the script Bravo to Gordon Levitt Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Spiralus 9 This movie is not for the feint of heart or the grown up minded It s probably not for church goers It s probably not REALLY for main stream consumers macho boys and candy princess girls It s not for any of these because it is at it s heart an attempt to savage the values that all these groups hold dear It shines a hot and otherwise absentee light the cancer of over sexualization It shows subtly at times and baldly at others how consumer driven sexualized culture has reached it s tendrils into every day life down even into the language we use how we think and what we think we need No character is safe even the heroine who chastises the male lead for being addicted to porn does so while lighting a joint Entertaining lighthearted and even touching this movie like it s main character seems dumb on the outside but turns out to be intelligent after all In fact it s really intelligent which will hurt it s reviews It s irreverence which I love makes it s target market small and it s high bar of entry most people won t get it makes it s target audience smaller still I took off a point the ending feeling rushed but truly I laughed my head off the whole time If you re not in any of those listed groups or if you re genuinely interested in gender roles feminism or sociology you need to see this Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Movie1997 8 In Joseph Gordon Levitt s directorial debut he has offered heart witty humor and a great script that shows the view of one man s deception on porn and how it has affected his humanity Overall great job Joseph Gordon Levitt Be sure to check out my YouTube channel TheMovieManLife for all things movies Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful jinringa 8 I thought it was a smart funny scathing but ultimately kind indictment of douche bro society The repetitiveness and shallowness of man child Jon s existence speaks loudly to my millenial sensibilities A victim of a self centered father and over accommodating mother Jon is a self centered douche bag whose only goal in life is to have meaningless fun The blank faces on Jon s family during church and his road rage on the way there speak towards the emptiness of being nominally religious The meaningless confession of sins the meaningless prayers all contribute to Jon s status as a shallow guy who doesn t really care about anything but banging an equally shallow and ridiculously hot girl and then spanking it to some meticulously selected pornography I think the fact that Barbara isn t actually a good person is a really important part of the film That neither party in the Jon Barbara relationship is actually that likable despite both of them being very good looking is pretty refreshing I really liked that Jon isn t actually that likable He s charming but he s a self centered dick with nothing really to say And then he grows and he s still kind of a dick and he doesn t really have that much to say but he is less self centered and I think that s a lot more honest than most other films I think attacking the tendency to be self centered through porn addiction was really clever Self centeredness is kind of this internal thing with tons of symptoms but it s really hard to pull at something and make a difference With Barbara it manifests as manipulativeness which I think is a really hard thing to make a person aware of in a meaningful way With porn addiction it s a pretty straight shot to you have a problem because you can t get off without porn I enjoyed it I liked watching Jon struggle and grow I liked that the ultimate love interest is really screwed up for totally believable reasons I liked that no one is actually that likable It feels like reality but slightly prettier as opposed to fantasy Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful SimpleMethod 7 As a debut Don Jon is pretty solid It was really far from perfect but again it s a debut I liked it but really didn t love it as much as I expected I might The porn gets a little annoying too Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Chazd3 1 As a mature male that enjoys movies attending 1 2 every week I blanched every time I saw the preview to the upcoming Don Jon All I got from it was a movie about porn addiction period Mentally I wrote it off Today I made a critical mistake I normally don t read the reviews of movies I know don t give me a single spark of interest only the sparky ones Alas the reviews were surprisingly acceptable and I went to a morning matinee What a waste It was a movie about porn addiction of course but I assumed from the reviews there were many redeeming qualities and growth in the characters included WRONG Joseph Gordon Levitt his father Tony Danza were simply vacuous crude foul mouthed and valueless all the way to the closing credits There was zero empathy or sympathy and not a hint of anyone being a protagonist I not only did not care about the males in this film I was repulsed by them The Catholic sacrament of confession was treated like an irrelevant waste basket for immoral behavior rather than anything sacred or religious and demanding of sincere repentance as it does in real life Scarlett Johansson and Julianne Moore performances were very good actually This movie had one theme and one theme only promiscuitypornpromiscuityporn I spent the last 30 minutes mentally flipping a coin on whether to just get up and leave I stayed because I wanted to write an honest review on a complete product On the way out a group of five in front of me complained out loud about their waste of time and money on that piece of trash I chimed in with them as we left the theater Expand 6 of 10 users found this

Credits Critic Reviews Score distribution Positive 2 out of 7 Mixed 5 out of 7 Negative 0 out of 7 The A V ClubReviewed by Nick SchagerAug 14 2013 75 Erik Sharkey s documentary is far less adventurous than Struzan s own creations using a straightforward chronological structure and talking head format to pay tribute to Struzan s legendary output All this critic s reviews Read full review VarietyReviewed by Peter DebrugeAug 18 2013 70 The director commissioned Struzan to paint the one sheet for his debut Sexina Popstar P I and while this sophomore effort is no masterpiece it s far more deserving of Struzan s talent All this critic s reviews Read full review The New York TimesReviewed by Andy WebsterAug 15 2013 60 At length the cheerleading becomes a mildly taxing torrent And Mr Struzan while an agreeable presence is not an especially engrossing speaker But then there is his artwork an essential aid to the movies and often their superior All this critic s reviews Read full

strong but Wilde is particularly good as the impetuous Kate who doesn t realize how incredibly selfish she has become The actress great beauty could have been a distraction but her performance is so

is one of the biggest sorprises of this year the story could be familiar but the development is really great ok sometimes falls into the known the script is really smart and the performances are wow incredible Anna Kendrick Olivia Wilde Jake M Johnson and Ron Livingston do a good job Great movie Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful hoops2448 7 I had an inkling on how Drinking Buddies was going to end going in but being right didn t mean I didn t enjoy the overall experience because I did In fact its a smart and well directed film with a fresh improvised style that makes the film performances shine so much that it ultimately didn t matter how the film ended the ride was enough The film follows best friends Kate Olivia Wilde and Luke Jake Johnson who work at a Chicago brewery together When Kate and Luke introduce each other to their respective partners things start to change for these two friends even though they don t realize it is happening Director Joe Swanberg uses his unique filming and story telling techniques to bring new life to a story as old as time While an unrequited love story is my Kryptonite Drinking Buddies is the anti rom com rom com as it isn t concerned with the trivial questions of who ends up with who it s a tale of life not just for Kate and Luke but everyone It s a story of personality how these people interact with each other warts and all Joined by Anna Kendrick as Luke s partner Jill and Ron Livingston as Kate s partner Chris Kendrick turns in yet another stand out performance as a supposedly chilled out yet secretly neurotic girl seeking more from Luke a man with a serious commitment phobia Livingston is an unexpected touch but an excellent choice none the less The real highlight though is Olivia Wilde who proves her worth after a slew of bad film appearances Cowboys and Aliens Ultimately a film like this doesn t come along very often despite Swanberg s impressive film turnout over the last 9 years and we should embrace it for what it is a heartfelt look at the frustrating nature of man and their ability to miss the simplest of things While a little long it all comes down to your personal taste as the film is all about the little things the small inconsequential moments that make up a persons life If that s not your thing thats fine but if it is your going to love it Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful BrianMcCritic 6 This is a solid film based on the strong chemistry between the four leads Unfortunately I felt that there was just something missing when it came to getting a good feel for the characters B Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Thegodfatherson 5 Drinking Buddies is a lethargic look at what happens when platonic friends tip toe the line between friendly and flirty that they drink is merely a device in which we re given to understand their commonplace While the plot is essentially aimless for the first three quarters of the movie the actors hold your attention by slowly and gently stroking the tension which comes to a head when Johnson s Luke helps Wilde s Gate move between Chicago apartments Ultimately the stars of Drinking Buddies give us some fun enough characters to hang out with for 90 minutes The true feelings and prerogatives of the main characters are reserved but for a few meaningful moments of which many are apparent to the audience only Despite and perhaps because of the creative control the actors were given in terms of improvised dialogue there s a lot of people not saying what they re thinking in this movie It s that frustrating passive aggression that makes this film feel as authentic and at times as too close to home hitting of any of Swanberg s films to date Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful var nr domain www metacritic com

me even surpasses it We get developed characters that we actually care about the performances by all were stellar especially Damon as the guy we can relate to and Copley in a scene chewing performance delivering one of the best villains in recent memory Foster was the too as the cutthroat politician Blomkamp has balls and his vision of two separate societies one of the diseased overpopulated planet and Elysium where the rich flourish disease free was richly brought to life truly a beautiful the effects by Weca are amazing I bought in to this future world and the plot actually had a purpose with something to say about our modern society while still being balls to the wall entertaining and affecting its audience Blomkamp delivers another classic go check it out i can t recommend enough Expand 15 of 28 users found this helpful Rekkr 9 Absolutely loved this film As a huge fan of District 9 this was actually exactly what I was expecting it to be Blomkamp s style is so distinct and in general I have never seen a Sci fi film quite like this I don t quite know what critics were expecting and it s particularly hard to tell when you have some wishing it was closer to District 9 while others criticize it for being too similar The fact is that Blomkamp has used many of the elements that made District 9 SO brilliant and has applied them to a rather different perspective of Science Fiction in my opinion to equally brilliant effect This film should be view completely independently which I understand is difficult for some Needless to say after seeing this film I am even MORE excited to see what Blomkamp does next Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful BrianMcCritic 8 A well crafted sci fi film about the have and the have nots Matt Damon gives his usual strong performance but the

theater expecting a district 9 please walk the opposite direction D9 does a much better job telling you the same exact theme and message That being said Elysium still has entertainment value and the technology featured throughout the movie is a hot slice of good old science fiction pie If anything the surroundings and settings served more of a character than the protagonists themselves At a point I found myself caring more about the side characters such as Spider than I did about Max Damon I felt Max was simply the vehicle taking me through the plot except when he gets a nice go pro angle camera and tears stuff up with his exo suit It feels incredibly unrealistic though that an everyday man could all of a sudden have the fighting experience to take on spec ops soldiers just because he has an exo suit I won t go into detail but with the way I see it Kruger Copley not only steals the show but by all logical means should have complete tactical supremacy against any opponent So you know what I take back what I said earlier If you expect to see D9 aka Copley being a thug then this movie IS for you because lets be honest there s merit in rooting for the bad guys Expand 0 of 0

performance by Jodie Foster I really can t say I recommend seeing it Some of the stuff that happens during the movie really stretches credulity almost to the breaking point I mean it s 2154 and people in L A are still driving GMC vehicles and riding buses Yet there are aircraft that can fly from the earth s surface to Elysium in 19 minutes A lot of discontinuities The ending is equally predictable and unbelievable Also it seemed a lot longer than an hour and 49 minutes Wait to see it at a matinee or on DVD is my advice Expand 6 of 7 users found this helpful mniro 0 AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL The story

getting to know you encounters in movie history All this critic s reviews Read full review indieWIREReviewed by Eric KohnSep 17 2013 91 Gandolfini deserves an Oscar for Enough Said not because it s

I enjoy all the characters and story lines and each episode is better than the last This is an interesting set of characters and well acted even though they may find themselves in rather contrived situations such as a car theft and ensuing chase by elderly drivers or locked in a creepy mansion The one on one conversations are superb I can t wait for the next episode and season Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Thegodfatherson 10 It s at this fine grained observation of human folly that Holofcener excels without ever abandoning her compassion for her wayward fumbling g characters A subplot about Eva s best friend s inability to fire her housekeeper gestures a bit too obliquely at social satire Holofcener s last two films Friends With Money and Please Give dealt more explicitly with matters of class and social mobility But I appreciate that this movie doesn t make us choose between context based character humor and snappy romantic banter instead it provides both in great bounty Elaine Benes and Tony Soprano may seem an unlikely pairing but Louis Dreyfus and Gandolfini make strangely persuasive bedfellows in fact they re one of the most impossible not to root for on screen couples in recent memory Gandolfini by all accounts was a gentle modest and sensitive man who felt emotionally depleted by the violent dark roles he was generally called on to play in the wake of The Sopranos Here we get a glimpse of the second career he could have had as a light comedic heartthrob That it won t ever come to be is only one of countless reasons to wish Gandolfini were still around Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful poetreviewer 9 Julia Louis Dreyfus and James Gandolflini are excellent in this movie Ben Falcone is great too The movie is touching comical and romantic I loved it Both main characters are gentle souls and really seem made for each other their on screen chemistry is amazing Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful MarcDoyle 8 Julia Louis Dreyfus is REALLY good in this movie She dials back the extreme version of herself that she trots out for Veep which I also enjoy and shows a vulnerable side which is touching Gandolfini is solid and serves his purpose but it s not his movie Keener also goes through the motions here and does her standard nice work I want to call out Ben Falcone who is hilarious in this film and the greenlighters need to put him in a starring role Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Movie1997 8 Look I m not a fan of rom com s but this for sure is the best one I ve ever seen Overall James Gandolfini you will be missed Be sure to check out my YouTube channel TheMovieManLife for all things movies Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful FilmmakingRe 7 This review contains spoilers click expand to view It s been three years since Nicole Holofcener last released a film and it s been fifteen years since Julia Louis Dreyfus appeared on screen The latter s previous appearance was in a Woody Allen s Deconstructing Harry so it s quite fitting that her return would be in a film by the former Though Holofcener s career is much younger than Allen s and not nearly as prolific her work feels right at home next to the typical Allen film Instead of intricate plots both directors prefer more open ended explorations of the privileged middle and upper classes and the various hijinks in which they dabble And even though Enough Said s style and structure occasionally feel like that of a network sitcom it is ultimately a highly enjoyable comedy albeit one that operates at a broader level than Holofcener s previous work Having directed episodes of TV s Parks and Recreation and Enlightened in the years since her last film the wonderful Please Give it s not entirely surprising that some sitcom y tendencies have slipped into Holofcener s authorial bloodstream With its abundance of characters and hazily sketched subplots Enough Said does have a tendency to feel like something of a pilot episode Some of the comedy arrives in fits and starts and some dialogue exchanges feel a too artificial for their own good Under different circumstances these traits would become large painful thorns in a film s side Enough Said thankfully has the low key level of craft and acting that elevates its material into territory that is entirely pleasurable rather than grating That elevation comes largely from Ms Louis Dreyfus as protagonist Eva and the late James Gandolfini as love interest Albert The pair of TV titans Louis Dreyfus is close to beating Lucille Ball s record amount of Emmy wins seem like an odd match at first glance And in fairness it s kind of hard to picture Elaine or the Veep going for Tony Soprano They appear to agree When the two divorcees meet at a party they both dryly comment that there s no one at the even they find attractive Yet that first shared sentiment turns out to be a hidden sign After a surprisingly enjoyable first date Eva and Albert s relationship starts to grow in ways they never expected Of course there are complications If you ve seen the trailer you know how Eva s relationship with new client Marianne Catherine Keener Ms Holofcener s muse of sorts throws a wrench in everything Yet whether or not you have foreknowledge of the film s surprise it s hardly likely to affect your perception of the film Holofcener keeps the pacing brisk never allowing the more dramatic undercurrents of the story to suck the fun out of the film as a whole At first that makes Enough Said seem rather slight And truthfully Enough Said is a modest unambitious character based comedy Yet even among the sitcom y scenes and situations there remains a remarkable attention to detail when it comes to the characters The ensemble is close to being overstuffed with friends ex husbands daughters and clients yet seeing Louis Dreyfus and Gandolfini play against type is more than enough to give the film some intrigue Watching the former handle less misanthropic and neurotic humor and watching the latter be funny at all proves to be the film s secret weapon With the amount of time TV stars spend in a role they tend to become associated with a certain persona and are thus more vulnerable to being typecast And even though Louis Dreyfus retains some facial tics from her Seinfeld days by the time Enough Said rolls into its final reels there s no mistaking Eva for Elaine The maternal compassion and hesitant romantic longing that the actress finds without going overboard is a delight to watch For such a simple set up Enough Said pulls its leading lady in a surprising number of directions Individually they may seem plain but the combination that Holofcener and Louis Dreyfus come up with here somehow feels fresh More subdued though just as enjoyable is Mr Gandolfini in one of his last roles While his untimely passing is tragic he could still be alive and his portrayal of Albert would be no less delightful A self professed slob Albert remains good at heart In situations where Tony Soprano would have lost his cool and started throwing punches Albert keeps a level head and internalizes his feelings of anger and disappointment It culminates in one of the film s best scenes that also happens to be one of the few dramatic ones in the entire 90 minute run time And even though Enough Said is broader than Holofcener s previous work it still has her keen ability to use character based comedy to touch on deeper emotional truths Jordan Baker for FMR Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful TheDavo 4 Contrived Hollywood story falls flat on its face about 2 3 of the way through the movie followed by 20 or 30 minutes of nothing and a completely implausible ending pasted on at the very end The casting is awful the ex s are all intolerable and the dialogue is

Lawrence ToppmanAug 29 2013 67 Gomez is a nonstarter as an actor alternating dully between petulance and indifference Hawke compensates with a vivid ferocious performance that doesn t go over the top All this critic s reviews Read full review The A V ClubReviewed by Ignatiy VishnevetskyAug 28 2013 42 For the most part Getaway lacks tension and violence Strobe cuts rob the stunts of any sense of motion twisting metal seen in half second snippets becomes abstracted texture While it s possible to appreciate this stuff on an individual level it doesn t quite add up to an action movie whole All

Slant MagazineReviewed by R Kurt OsenlundAug 29 2013 25 Though always speeding forward in some gear of ridiculousness the film is a lot more fun when it s completely nonsensical before its baddie s motives and harebrained plot are funnel fed to the viewer All this publication s reviews Read full review San Francisco ChronicleReviewed by Peter HartlaubAug 29 2013 25 You ve probably seen this

that premieres on Cinemax on a Friday night sandwiched between two soft core porn movies with funny titles Getaway is stuck in neutral And that s where it ll stay All this critic s reviews Read full

on Selena she was great Maybe it was a little hard but really She s only 21 cut her some slack Expand 0 of 13 users found this helpful gabecampos 5 Was not good and not to bad The acting are so poor and the movie was to silly with that Selena Gomez that act like a child statue because she looks like Kristen Stweart in the Twilight Movies Expand 2 of 5 users found this helpful TVJerry 4 You d think a movie that s 90 fast driving with dozens of car crashes couldn t help but be exciting You d be wrong Such an over edited non stop onslaught becomes pretty pedestrian because the action is uninspired Pair that with this ridiculous plot Ethan Hawke is forced to drive like a maniac and cause absurd destruction to save his kidnapped wife Toss in Selena Gomez as his sassy hi tech ride along to really strain credibility Granted the manic editing keeps it from being boring but the lackluster direction keeps it from being thrilling Less fast furious and more fast flaccid Expand 0 of 2 users found this helpful Kadeemluvmusic 1 There s nothing much worse for Getaway as if Ethan Hawke and Selena Gomez would ve been hijacked at a strip club I m just saying Yeah I thought Getaway was supposed to be a great movie It turns out that this is a Taken Drive ripoff The chemistry of Hawke and Selena is very simple just like in R I P D bad acting terrible script the action scenes were pretty bland because Ethan Hawke is no Ryan Gosling or Liam Neeson but he should ve known better I really like Selena s raunchy performance in Spring Breakers and Mavis in Hotel Transylvania but there s one problem I don t think an action film might be a good choice for her and that s why Getaway should be my pick for the worst movies of 2013 along with Scary Movie V and After Earth Expand 1 of 3 users found this helpful PStakhiv 1 90 minutes of driving car in Bulgaria is that supposed to be interesting Boring flawed story terrible directing awful action One of the worst movie of the year along with Scary Movie 5 Grown Ups 2 Expand 2 of 2 users found this helpful Glitter 1 Hawke swoops in to drag Gomez s career to new depths The starved Disney sex kitten purrs her way through scatological expletives as the plot races by as a fast paced testosterone orgasm of car crashes by the dozens Because literally that sentence is perhaps the entirety of this film Gomez failure to maintain her aggressive nature let alone capture it and portray a mature carjacker only supports Hawke s failure in playing the pigeon to Voight s waning career Expand 2 of 4 users found this helpful Thegodfatherson 0 Cribbing from countless adrenaline fueled concept films from Speed to any Jason Statham movie you like Getaway not to be confused with the two The Getaway films based on Jim Thompson s novel tries to ride its thin concept hoping the fumes of constant engine revving are intoxicating Director Courtney Solomon splices together footage from cameras inside the car from which the kidnapper eyes his pawns and from exterior stuntmen enabled wide shots The action all at nighttime is messily and crudely filmed The plot mechanics are often laughable How then to explain the film s sudden elegance in one and only one shot that appears toward the end of the film like a parting of the waters Suddenly the frantic cutting and the relentlessly grating score dissipate for a lengthy first person perspective of a car speeding down a rolling suburban road gracefully sliding around traffic at dawn It s a diamond that can t make up for the other 89 minutes of rough Expand 3 of 5

Score distribution Positive 1 out of 1 Mixed 0 out of 1 Negative 0 out of 1 whitewind 8 Haute Cuisine is a charming excellently paced and well written film Foodies and especially those who admire French cuisine will get a great deal out of this film But even those not particularly atuned to fine French cooking will enjoy this film about a female chef hired by the French President for his private kitchen and her adventures with the male cooks and chefs of the main kitchen But this is handled in a very sophisticated manner without temper tantrums and underhanded activities between the parties Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful var nr domain www metacritic com var nrelate dwparams mapp nrelate comptype widget comp 380 riaevent view s6 document location href s7 US google ad

blurring the lines between make believe and reality Rocks Grenades Trees Control towers Sticks Submachine guns The youthful innocence of the game gradually takes on a different tone as the quest for

of the violence and racial slurs if the film had been fun or had an important message but this film does neither I enjoy films involving kids in a much more adult themed way such as Kick Ass or kids involved in fun adventures such as Goonies This film left me cold to the point where it s almost offensive D Expand 0 of 2 users found this helpful var nr domain www metacritic com var nrelate

ambitious than it sometimes seems All this critic s reviews Read full review VarietyReviewed by John AndersonApr 23 2013 90 To call Lake Bell a magnetic intelligent blithely screwball leading lady in the Carole Lombard tradition might be selling her short With In a World a rollicking laffer about the cutthroat voiceover biz in Los Angeles she proves herself a comedy screenwriter to be reckoned with All this critic s reviews Read full review Chicago Sun TimesReviewed by Richard RoeperAug 15 2013 88 Before this movie Lake Bell seemed to have a nice and comfortable career path ahead of her She was an actress who always provided a spark whether the vehicle was mundane or first rate Now she s a name that provokes keen anticipation Can t wait to see what Lake Bell the filmmaker does next All this critic s reviews Read full review New York Daily NewsReviewed by Joe NeumaierAug 8 2013 80 It s hard to imagine the lives behind the voices that are part of the movies But In a World the debut feature from actress turned writer director Lake Bell not only gives the people who do movie voice overs a closeup it savvily and wittily uses what we hear as a metaphor for what we are All this

overlooked world of voice over as a backdrop Bell has delivered a film that is an important social satire without the snobbish condescension which that designation may imply Read the full review here http bit ly 17C0Gw1 Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful TVJerry 7 The voiceover business is largely a man s world esp for movie trailers Lake Bell wrote directed stars as a woman who s trying to break in It doesn t help that her father Fred Melamed is one of the leaders in the biz and unsupportive of her efforts Although the overall mood is upbeat there aren t a lot of outright laffs The cast in enjoyable and the energy never wanes This inside look at show biz with a healthy dose of relationship challenges could almost be a Woody Allen satire Not especially memorable but fun Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Mike M 5 Not at all bad but not great or memorable Given her talents and experience it seems that Bell might have done better with her first feature if she d made a sketch driven comedy and saved a comedy with a serious side for a later outing As it is there aren t enough of the funny bits while more or less everything about the serious side falls flat The dramatic elements the depth of the character and writing the framing and composition the social satire they re all pretty slight The tone shifts back and forth between a sort of pure laughs comedy Anchorman etc and a serious comedy or satire some Woody Allen Noah Baumbach etc The clash inherent in this tone shift undercuts the serious side rather forcefully If that weren t enough the serious elements in themselves are pretty sophomoric However it is enjoyable and warm hearted and Bell shows some chance of a better outing in the future Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful OnTrust 5 Interesting that all the male white roles in the film are caricatures and all save one of the female roles are heroic tragic despite severe character flaws I wonder how the screenwriter would have portrayed a male that was an immoral thirty something couch surfer or a philandering hotel employee who sleeps with the paying guests Feminist indeed This won the screenwriting award at Sundance hmmmmm Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Bikerjames 3 Bell has a future writing bad sitcoms for television as that is what this movie felt like to me People do not converse normally and although it had a few laughs most fell flat for me As an example the conversation between the neighbor who needs to borrow the shower she had plumbing problems and Gary had me moaning it was so unrealistic and silly and LONG Still I did think the acting was good throughout and the pacing was good If you hate silly madcap TV sitcoms you won t like this movie Expand 0 of 2 users found this helpful GreatMartin 2 When was the last time you heard a female voice over on a trailer for a coming attraction Okay let s go for an easier question like when wasas the last time you saw a film with a father who is a male chauvinist whose thinks daughters should be seen and not heard How about an easier question like when was the last time you saw a film starring a person who also wrote and directed that film Did you think it was a vanity production or that person couldn t find anyone better to do any of the 3 jobs or possibly they couldn t afford to pay someone In The World stars Lake Bell as Carol her debut feature as a writer and director and who has played secondary roles in movies and television In this film she explores the world of voice overs and the people mainly men who make a living at that job Carol finds herself in competition with her father Sam Fred Melamed who has recently taken over the mantle as the man with the best voice after the recent star Don LaFontaine has passed away and Gustav Werner Ken Marino his prodigy Carol who had been living with her father has to move in with her sister Dani Michaela Watkins and brother in law Gary Rob Corddry because dad has moved in his much younger and supposedly ditzy girlfriend Jamie Alexander Holden while let s not forget the guy Louis Demetri Martin that is pining after Carol and of course is the last to know it There is no faulting Lake Bell as an actress as she comes across trained to be a loser but endearing to all including the audience As the screenplay writer she tries to cover too much ground in a 93 minutes film but it is as a director that she makes too many mistakes with uncalled for dark shots holding the camera on the wrong person in many scenes and not focusing the story with her actors There is a lot going on here besides the father daughters situation the competition sister and husband having a marital crisis Carol getting unnecessarily involved with Gustave the lack of good jobs for women in an industry that exploits them plus showing Carol giving voice lessons to various actresses including Eva Longoria It is very seldom that I have seen a bad performance by an actor hey I liked Russell Crowe in Les Miserables in a film and there isn t one here The main fault of In a World is that it takes 90 minutes in a 93 minute film to get to the payoff and getting there is very slow and unfunny though those last 3 minutes are touching Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful var nr domain www metacritic com var nrelate dwparams mapp nrelate comptype widget comp 380 riaevent view s6 document location href

little academic spew one sided neo liberal ideology Reich is an example of what happens when an intelligent man becomes immersed in neo liberal ideology and cut off from the real world of economics and human nature Contrary to Reich s unsupported premise income and wealth inequality are not harmful rather they are evidence a healthy moral society People are rewarded with income based on their relative value to society Those who create or otherwise provide value are rewarded with commensurate income These whose contributions are minimal are compensated with less Executives who create innovation efficiency and profit are appropriately paid more than low level workers with easily replaceable skills And of course as to investing and wealth management as the old quote goes A Fool and His Money Are Soon Parted All of this makes not only good economic sense it is morally fair and just Conversely taking wealth from some and giving it to others is theft Being an aloof academic Reich does not realize how silly his ideas are to practical people He blames the wealthy and income inequality for causing recent financial collapses On the contrary it is government meddling and over regulation that cause collapses When economic and financial prudence are replaced with neo liberal ideology and when risk is guaranteed by the government even a fool but not a neo liberal can predict that economic and financial harm will result When lenders are forced by government to make loans to unqualified borrowers common sense dictates that defaults will occur When those defaults occur the government taxpayers will be forced to make good on bad guaranteed loans Without government meddling lenders would only loan money to those with demonstrated ability to repay the loans Similarly societal income and wealth disparities eventually force the wealthy and business owners to make price and wage concessions to the less fortunate so they can buy products and participate in the economy History demonstrates that without government meddling the marketplace adjusts wages price income and wealth All of the harmful effects of which Reich speaks are CAUSED by governmental efforts to redistribute wealth provide more resources for the less fortunate and remove risk from the economy These governmental efforts must necessarily result in financial ruin because they have no basis in real world economics and human nature None of these facts matter in the fantasy ideological world Reich and neo liberal academics politicians have created for themselves Were Reich and the neo liberals relegated to the halls of academia there might be little harm from their nonsense The problem for society is that these dangerous people have now taken control of the government and media Despite powerful evidence of their ongoing failures neo liberals like Reich remain hell bent on implementing their pernicious ideologies Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful var nr domain www

Whannell s Insidious Chapter 2 fully delivers in terms of exploring the mysteries left behind in the previous installment while also expanding on its intriguing mythology However the sequel also embraces the first film s quirkier campier aspects which makes for a few good laughs but also some less than terrifying horror sequences It s an excellent horror piece to swivel into the spiral of its previous film Expand 6 of 8 users found this helpful christianl13 10 This movie and the previous movie did a great job It has a reasonable state of each events Like director wan is focused on the flow of each events He made it clarify and clear for the audience how it is happened why is it happening how it happened Normally we can see that the movie has many repetitions but that s because director wan wants us to understand each events While I m watching this chapter 2 I said to myself that Oh so that s why As your fans we are expecting an another chapter from this movie In the end we can see that there s another entity again if you really deep understand the story you will feel that there is still something wrong and like it is not done there is still something that we don t know I don t know if anybody feel that Overall my ratings would be 100 excellent movie Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Aedrone12 9 Chapter 2 will surely be a greatest hit on this years scale I went to see this movie expecting a lame chapter 2 like most movie make but it really surprised me when I got there I jumped and loved this part 2 Al though the sounds are a bit bad I still loved this movie I recommend this movie to anyone Expand 1 of 3 users found this helpful Ocgem24 7 Never seeing the first installment I was able to understand this second installment without watching the first This movie to me felt like a mixture of The Sixth Sense and The Others This installment goes into detail and explains what happened in the first chapter and why it was happening Throughout the movie you never loosen up because there is always something that has you in suspense In my opinion the make up effects could have been more scarier It doesn t contain any gruesome killing foul language or nudity which I know some parents may want to know before letting their kids watch it Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful BrianMcCritic 7 I like the first one a tad more but this film is still a lot of fun I know James Wan is moving on from the horror genre but I hope not for good the guys got a real talent with making films that mixes scares with a solid sense of humor B Expand 2 of 2 users found this helpful ROFLoom 6 Honestly I feel like they put a lot of thought into this story they just weren t amazing at telling it Some things happened so abruptly that I had to ask my fellow movie goers how they got from one place to the other There are too many spirits to focus on that look alike and I don t know which spirit is possessing who and who is actually dead in the further and apparently you can time travel while in the further and it was just sort of confusing I feel like they made things up mid story just to make the story tie in and work The acting on Rose Byrne s part was good and for a lot of the part I thought Patrick Wilson was decent as a possessed guy until the end it got kind of cheesy I ve seen this film twice now and the first time I thought it was scary the second time not so much which just goes to show that a lot of the scares are because of the unexpected rather than because of the unknown and wonder The horror flicks that mess with your mind are the best kinds like the Blair Witch Project Paranormal Activity etc This was watchable for a horror sequel it actually wasn t bad the music volume has GOT to be lowered though Good lord Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Rex richards 1 If you are not a fan of the first movie don t bother This movie is extremely cheaply made and really formulaic and unexceptional Where I live in england they have a trailer showing the audience screaming at the shocks to try and get you to go a technique which works well unless you look closely and realise the audience members screaming look like 12 year old girls Really not one at all for any adult over the age of 20 unless you are really really bored Expand 1 of 3 users found this helpful See all 30 User Reviews var nr domain www metacritic com var

29 2013 70 Some of the comic bits are a little too broad and silly but Derbez in his feature debut makes Instructions Not Included a balancing act more successful than it should be All this critic s reviews Read full review Los Angeles TimesReviewed by Annlee EllingsonSep 4 2013 70 There s a lot of movie here with unexpected developments held together by the irresistible chemistry between Derbez and his adorable pint sized co star All this critic s reviews Read full review Washington PostReviewed by Michael O SullivanSep 6 2013 63 The film s counterintuitive success is largely due to Derbez who demonstrates why he is beloved both south and north of the border All this critic s reviews Read full review Movie NationReviewed by Roger MooreSep 11 2013 50 The ending of the movie is a real grabber the sort of thing that lifts and improves a tediously long and otherwise mediocre film and tricks you into thinking it was better than it really was as you leave the theater All this critic s reviews Read full review VarietyReviewed by Joe LeydonSep 5 2013 40 Instructions Not Included is a sporadically amusing but unduly protracted dramedy that slowly very slowly devolves into a shameless tearjerker during its third act All this critic s reviews Read full review User Reviews Write a Review Score distribution Positive 13 out of 16 Mixed 0 out of 16 Negative 3 out of 16 Carlin77 10 It is a movie to remember It is one of the greatest comdys of all time It will become a classic instantly Eugenia Derbez is in one of his best performances of all time and the best since he ended the show

It made me laugh so much and cry towards the end Very good story line la la loved it No one walked out of that movie disappointed they all agreed it was a fantastic movie P s dont forget your tissues Expand 2 of 2 users found this helpful beinghuman 10 Comedy drama and the whole range of emotions in between the story has definite cultural characteristics that make it more powerful if understood However the conflict of values generated by the plot a single freedom loving beach bum in Acapulco faced with the responsibility of raising a daughter traveling to a country he does not understand and forging a happy life in the face of the most devastating adversity is universal and should touch everyone s heart When an artist has the inspiration to move the audience from laughter to tears he has accomplished his goal of touching people s lives The critics have spoken now the public is raving A masterpiece of a great comedian Go see it for yourself Highly recommend it Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful RUSOFAPGAR2001 10 Great movie very few movies make me cry an laugh at the same time if you consider the 5 million budget this movie is great hit its a must see movie in any language in any country you will get the message Highly recomended Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful webswever 10 This movie has the emotional intensity of BELLA the humor of JUNO and the social ramifications of KRAMER vs KRAMER I know I have watched a good movie when a year later I scan the video store shelf and I can remember the plot of the movie Trust me you will remember everything from this film Loved the line sincerely expressed by a friend to the new Mexican father You better learn English so you can understand your American baby when she starts speaking Don t let the subtitles keep you away Expand 2 of 2 users found this helpful TVJerry 6 This is the highest grossing Spanish language film to open in North America and it s aimed squarely at the family film audience that Disney targets Eugenio Derbez who also co wrote directed plays a ladies man whose life is upended when one of his former girlfriends drops off her baby at his door Seven years later she shows back up to re claim the daughter he s raised This is big on sentiment broad comedy dramatic conflict and tender emotion Loreto Peralta the daughter is sweet and appealing The audience around me was enthusiastic some of the references are strictly cultural and the movie is not without charms but it s not likely to appeal to English speaking families because of the subtitles Expand 2 of 2 users found this helpful lexlexmsb 0 We have seen this type of story over and over again last time the playboy was interpreted by Adam Sandler in Big Daddy This movie is predictable it represents bad television and bad film making the kind sadly sponsored by Televisa to a public with very low standards and expectations Derbez acting and characterization of a playboy is highly poorly drafted and executed Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful See all 16 User Reviews var nr domain www metacritic com var nrelate dwparams mapp nrelate comptype widget comp 380 riaevent view s6 document location

did a very great job and this movie makes me sort of want to buy a mac or and iphone NOT but in all great movie you wont be disappointed Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful AlexProductions 6 How does somebody know what they want if they haven t even seen it This one sentence really explained to me why Apple was created JOBS is the biography film recreation of Steve Jobs Ashton Kutcher life Being founder of Apple we follow him and Steve Wozniak Josh Gad as they create the company and watch it flourish The film starts in 2001 picture two as Steve introduces the first iPod and then it jumps back to mid 70 s when the company first started Starting the company in his parent s garage with the other Steve we follow him through his hard work in Apple We could tell that Steve really was a jerk after starting his company but we also saw how he cared about his good friends and about the association The movie really gave me an understanding on how his life changed the world I learned that words did not affect Steve he never gave up with hundreds of people hanging up on his phone pitches and in live demos The film JOBS really showed how great of an actor Kutcher is Throughout the film I was convinced that he was Steve Jobs He had got everything right even down to the walk Steve actually carried Being an Apple fan I really enjoyed JOBS I think that any viewer would enjoy the film but I feel like the movie will only attract people who care about the history of Apple It s more of a selective audience for this film because there is no point in seeing it if you are not an Apple fanatic I think Josh Gad also did a great job as Wozniak and I still think he and Jonah Hill have the same voice Even in the 130 minutes the film ran JOBS did not cover the last decade of his life when Apple really took off Sequel maybe I wasn t sure if Open Road Films which I ve never heard of had to pull the plug on the ending After thinking about the film my only idea is that they did not need to continue the film because we can just pull out the device in our pockets They did not need to cover the next decade because we already know what happens The company expands so greatly that Steve gets his wish of changing the world with over 25 of American adults owning iPhones I felt the film started to drag on even though some scenes were rushed For example Steve s wife and children came into the picture at a time that didn t seem appropriate Overall I think Jobs really defines Steve s life and the start and growth of the company everyone knows about If you own an iDevice or want to learn more about Steve JOBS is the movie for you Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful csw12 5 The movie is quite entertaining and not bad overall but where it fails miserably is the decision to cast Aston Kutcher Every moment that is suppose to be taken seriously having feeling or make a point comes across as cheesy Jobs is certainly no Social Network Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Nesbitt10 3 Joshua Michael Stern s Jobs is like an assembly line for the best moments in the life of Steve Jobs but without any depth and without significance It is a truly unremarkable biopic of the master of innovation as you can possibly imagine Jobs follows an overly safe unimaginative course that clocks in at a tiresome 122 minutes The storytelling is painfully straightforward covering only the principal events of his professional trials and tribulations and providing little else beyond what is already public knowledge Developing his imagination for computer programming at Atari Steve brought in pal Steve Wozniak Josh Gad to help with the hardware and forming a partnership that would soon lead to the founding of Apple Computers Developing Apple into an industry force throughout the 1980s Steve is not prepared for the financial demands and the ruthless business mentality and eventually forced out of the company he began only to return in the 1990s with a fresh game plan on how to bring Apple back into the public consciousness Jobs is a biopic with a very narrow focus and without any sense of risk or adventure It is so intent on covering Jobs entire corporate career that it simply reduces his personal life to a footnote Stern completely glosses over Jobs personal life which is essential to any self respecting biopic The entire production feels rushed and slapped together simply to benefit from being the first one out of the gate To his credit Kutcher puts forth a good effort and he undeniably looks the part of Steve Jobs Unfortunately Ashton always looks like he is trying too hard to play the part and never fully becomes the character he s portraying His limitations are a major liability He has developed a screen persona as likeable character which has served him well with numerous TV sitcoms Not so much with movies What emerges is a movie that has a made for TV feel depicting a self absorbed creep who stabs everyone in the back to simply to get his way that goes on for over two hours A thoroughly unsatisfying tribute and we are still left none the wiser as to what made The Father of the Digital Revolution beyond what we already know Expand 7 of 7

fast forward it just showed a few events that occurred yet somehow it was dragged to over 2 hours Ashton Kutcher was possibly the worst possible choice to play Steve Jobs only thing he did well was Steve s walk which really isn t a big deal at all It s not all his fault as to why this film was bad the other reason is Joshua Michael Stern who has next to nothing under his belt director or writer wise This movie was written horribly and Ashton Kutcher like I said before was the worst choice Ben Affleck would ve been a great choice in my opinion but I know Ben certainly wouldn t agree to be a part of this awful script 3 10 although 2 is probably more deserving but I ll give it a charity point Not a complete disaster I ve seen worse but still pretty darn bad Don t waste your time and definitely don t waste your hard earned cash Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Tessara Vejgan 0 Boring movie complete waste of my time I wish there was more to it not just a history lesson that

with Chloe Grace Moretz Aaron Taylor Johnson Christopher Mintz Plasse and Jim Carrey After defeating Frank D amico Mindy and Dave try to live like normal people in high school but Priam can not be comfortable and prefers to remain vigilant on the streets in the guise of Hit Girl and the other tired of monotony of their lives as normal teenager initially decides to join the team with Mindy but after the latter retires Kick Ass decides to become a part of the Justice Forever commanded by Colonel Stars and Stripes Jim Carrey Meanwhile Chris D Amico in revenge for the death of his father he decides to become the first super villain of the story with the name of and to enlist the criminals in his gang In comparison to other sequel Kick Ass 2 does not disappoint and is proving an excellent film Wadlow s direction is not the same level of Vaughn but it can boast of being able to do the choreography really spectacular especially when fighting Hit Girl and manage well the crowd scenes the final battle The main focus of this film is Chloe Moretz and the psychological relationship Mindy Hit Girl Also excellent in the role that improves Johnson of Kick Ass Mintz Plasse who with his manages to entertain a lot and Jim Carrey who always manages to leave a mark Also note the great fidelity to the original comic although the most violent scenes have been removed Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful bloodhoof 10 This review contains spoilers click expand to view KICK ASS 2 Review spoilers by megafish try to have fun otherwise what s the point wise word that fit with this movie Im rating each character Music reused from previous movie but some new songs like I hate myself for lovin you when the saints go marching Characters same actors but have gotten older so they feel different but I still like them Team Justice forever Kick ass felt like he was saying lines directly from the comic HE IS RIPPED Jim carry great character deranged yeah there s a dog on your balls try to have fun otherwise what s the point Eisenhower the dog on your balls I honestly wouldn t have minded if they had of killed the dog but maybe it would have changed everything I love when mofo says im not that evil when some one asks him if he wants to kill the dog Hit girl very important and more deeper still great acting I saw worried about her character being a victim but it was cool I love how they had the moter bike scene from the prequel comic of hit girl when she and Marcus race each other to the house Insect man no mask open homosexual reminded me of the blue power ranger because he was ridiculed for being gay but insect man gets acceptance Action guy he was a nice edition and played out the same as in the comic Night I like how she had a fling with kick ass and that made more sense for mofo to kill her she looks better in the movie Other Katie protected from being attacked But instantly breaks up with dave because of hitgirl Marcus was interesting considering mindy s mother was dead in the movie Daves dad also exactly taken from the comic Villains toxic mega Mother er great new costume some funny lines way darker occasional voice change that reminds me of Eddie killbane prior from saints row 3 I was dreading when he attacks night not Katie like in the comic but thankfully it was softer Mother Russia I was hoping they d cut her head off she looked cooler in the movie Scenes hit girl on the van expanded The last battle felt a little messy and was premature in the comic kick ass and hit girl go to the lair and fight goons and later the big battle in the centre of the city blowing up comic shops The comic more violent and sexual The movie still violent not sexually violent Note atomic commix wasn t init they put posters from comics made by the writer of the comic mark Millar like American Jesus and superior It wasn t as fresh as the original but I liked it stars Expand 1 of 2 users found this helpful LTR 10 This movie is AMAZING The story is great

Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful jlplatten 7 I love the first Kick Ass and even though this sequel wasn t as good Kick Ass 2 was still a very entertaining movie I would say the biggest downfall was that the director completely missed the heart of the original However the action was great and the humor just as good I really liked all the new characters in this film because each was unique and brought a different perspective on vigilante super heroism Of course Hit Girl was the best part but I would disagree with many that she was the only good part If you are a fan of the first I guarantee that you ll like this one Expand 2 of 7 users found this helpful PStakhiv 5 Jeff Wadlow decided to take a different approach than the first Kick Ass and he made a terrible mistake The dialog in this

I couldn t take my eyes off in a long time This movie is worth an Oscar Cecil is a great actor He is a great storyteller I appreciate great work he put in the movie It made me cry to learn what these people went through and it made me feel grateful for the way it is now It shows you that America is becoming the best country now Let s be grateful that all the people in this past made this change happen All hate and segregation The people in the past changed that and made America into one Overall it is a masterpiece movie that I will always remember in my heart Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful JamesCannon 9 This movie is so cool it stars a rich black lady who plays a butlers wife It has all kinds of great drama and history facts and civil rights Black Power I love how the people playing the white president made them look like complete ignorant racist dotting idiots My only complaint is I wish Jayz was on the soundtrack or maybe lfrench montana to add some spunk to the setting This movie will warm you heart and make you cry about how far we have come as a nation from all stupid white people who have all come before the great Obama Yes WE CAN YES WE CAN Expand 1 of 3 users found this helpful ArtK 8 Though some of the casting choices seemed odd John Cusack as Richard Nixon the principals of the film were in fine form Forest Whitaker stars as the man who served as a White House butler during eight administrations quietly watching the Civil Rights movement unfold For me however the real standouts though were Oprah Winfrey his wife Terrence Howard his neighbor David Oyelowo his oldest son and Jane Fonda as Nancy Reagan For the first half of the film I was entranced by the scenes involving the fight for civil rights but didn t embrace the central characters mostly Whitaker like I wanted to BUT the last 45 minutes packed a punch that took me by surprise Some amazing scenes close out this film elevating it from good to very good History politics great acting and a mute Mariah Carey make this a must see film 1 2 out of 4 Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Beowulf4862 7 I wanted to see more about the travails of a black butler in the literally White House Instead we focus on his private life and more importantly the life of his eldest son Still this ploy allows us to march down the long hard road of civil rights pioneers This is a great history lesson for young blacks and for any and all Americans as well Lots of cameos who knew Alan Rickman could make such a good Ronald Reagan but the two leads provide most of the acting kudos in this timely film Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful amboy 6 The film tries to connect the history of race relations and the story of a family It fails to do so It trivializes and vulgarizes everything it touches The cameo appearances backfire badly Robin Williams and Alan Rickman are spectacularly miscast Forest Whitaker is extraordinary and his work redeems the family story but cannot do much for the political history One critic has called The Butler more of a history lesson than a film It utterly fails to do justice to our common and very different histories Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful ThePizzaman100 1 This movie is well done and Forest Whitaker gives a great performance but I m giving it a 1 because it just undeniably racist Okay reference Obama great that s cool first black president is a big deal I understand that When you say that Reagan one of the greatest presidents ever was a racist that pisses me off There is no reason to have put that in the story It s wrong and frankly just a low pointless act of racism White people can t do anything about it though but just wow based a true story Right this is why racism still exists Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful

porn explosion Deep Throat was a phenomenon the first scripted pornographic theatrical feature film featuring a story some jokes and an unknown and unlikely star Linda Lovelace Escaping a strict religious family Linda discovered freedom and the the high life when she fell for and married charismatic hustler Chuck Traynor As Linda Lovelace she became an international sensation less centerfold fantasy than a charming girl next door with an impressive capacity for fellatio Fully inhabiting her new identity Linda became an enthusiastic spokesperson for sexual freedom and uninhibited hedonism

of 7 Negative 2 out of 7 foxgrove 7 Unlike the year s earlier The Look of Love which also dealt with a porn industry icon Lovelace is actually very informative if a somewhat sanitised and one sided depiction of events in the life of Linda Lovelace of Deep Throat fame At a modest 93 minutes there is a lot to pack in and at times scenes seem to end with an exclamation mark to lead us succinctly in to the next chapter of L L s life The film is very well served by its actors Amanda Seyfried has never before given such an accomplished performance but that being so she is still eclipsed by Peter Sarsgaard as her husband Chuck Traynor who as painted here is very much the villain of the piece Sarsgaard is breath takingly brilliant and steals the acting honours from a strong line up of character actors with some ease An unrecognizable Sharon Stone also registers strongly in support as Linda s down trodden mum and the choice of soundtrack and costumes fit the period to perfection All in all this is a much better movie than I expected given the luke warm reviews and on reflection I feel that it has been rather under rated Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful BrianMcCritic 6 This is an extremely well acted film which allows for a mild recommendation As much as you learn about Linda Lovelace I feel we aren t able to get to a strong enough emotional level because the script glosses over to much B Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful TVJerry 6 Linda Lovelace Amanda Seyfried was the most famous porn star and her movie Deep Throat was the biggest grossing XXX ever This biopic starts with the passionate wide eyed exciting version of her story but switches halfway thru to reveal the truth her husband Peter Sarsgaard pimped her out and abused her This dark and unfortunate film has a strong cast Sharon Stone Robert Patrick have the most touching scenes as her parents and lots of garish 70s style While it s relentlessly cruel it never conjures up much sympathy It s an over the top biopic that s more instructional than emotional Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful RevRon 6 The real life story of Linda Lovelace and Deep Throat was a pretty interesting affair so having a bio pic made about her wasn t that surprising However the plot is a little messy and the story tends to ignore some important facts about her life and in doing so made the film feel more like a collection of short stories from Lovelace s journey than the actual story But the subject material is interesting and the performances are strong As a drama it s great As a bio pic it s okay Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful Fitzpaula 5 It is not a bad but also not a good movie It s pretty much a meh movie The biggest problem is the sweet sweet irony because while trying to show us that a prude society can t be one that makes sexuality safe this film is terribly prude and probably unwillingly scandalizes sex itself It is also a shame that Amanda Seyfried is unable to capture any of Lovelace s fabled screen presence and leaves the character rather bland and one dimensional it is not a terrible watch but it also doesn t add anything new to well anything Expand 0 of 0 users found

This review contains spoilers click expand to view Here in Ukraine I had such a great opportunity to see Metallica almost live in the real arena Something that does usually happen here I think that everything was made with a good sense of style and no cheese Really I have nothing bad to say about the movie All is great The best part for was the credits part in the end with them playing Orion for the empty arena Very very touching Couldn t help not thinking about the tragic loss of Cliff Thanks Metallica for this risky try using only your resources Hope it will be fully paid off Expand 0 of 1

mixed with a story line full of symbolism about human nature and a young man s trip pun intended into his own subconscious Definitely recommended for Metallica or heavy metal fans and anyone who likes

earlier in the day His surreal trip across the city interrupted by car crashes riots and more functions as both a linking device and a music video accompaniment to the set DeHaan looks like Alden Ehrenreich who in turns looks like Leonardo DiCaprio which is a nice prize in the genetic lottery The result is what every concert movie strives for the sense of being there but with a far better view

add really No meaningful plot no distinctive visuals If you love Metallica songs or at least hard rock and you feel perfectly fine about listening them for 1 5 hours then this movie is for you If not

the U S Federal Reserve has never been greater Markets and governments around the world hold their breath in anticipation of the Fed Chairman s every word Yet the average person knows very little about the most powerful and least understood financial institution on earth Narrated by Liev Schreiber Money For Nothing is the first film to take viewers inside the Fed and reveal the impact of Fed policies past present and future on our lives Join current and former Fed officials as they debate the critics and each other about the decisions that helped lead the global financial system to the

season award She plays a brittle socially prickly spinster living with her frail ailing mother We learn early that she gave up her child at 14 and we are to presume that this has brought her to cope by keeping people at a distance which she does with great success through the personality of a haughty reactive woman with her own arcane sense of social propriety The child she gave up is played by Naomi Watts who is also a bitter loner who has her mother s genes and the story to match Naomi s character is far more powerful than Bennings While Benning is a shrill cold arrogant woman who s

mellower role after taking umbrage at his inviting her to dinner alone The message is clear I make the moves here Then without much of a break she seduces the next door married neighbor Because she

of archival footage dedicated to legend man myth and flawed mortal that was Johnny Cash This film is a universal and troubling tale of the very real walls that parents can build around themselves J Jonathan s father Saul Holiff was Cash s manager in the 1960s and 70s Refreshingly My Father and the Man In Black does not slip into the realm of tabloid It s an intense personal adventure with universal themes and appeal that just happens to feature one of 20th century music s great icons New Chapter Productions Expand Director Jonathan Holiff Genre s Documentary Rating Not Rated Runtime 87

brilliant and entirely devoid of political piety All this critic s reviews Read full review The PlaylistReviewed by Gabe ToroSep 20 2013 83 Director Shaka King has made a film of big laughs and big

Jordan Rieke Jusef Anthony Mary Weiss Michael Oldani Paul Clough Paula Yarr Robert Helms Summary Doctors today are liberally writing prescriptions for psychotropic drugs such as Adderall Ambien Zoloft and Prozac to name a very few Often these drugs are combined in polypharmacy cocktails or are given out for unapproved or untested indications leading to abuse dangerous side effects and heavy dependence Off Label examines our runaway pharma culture by weaving together the stories of drug testing subjects Big Pharma representatives and many others touched by the rampant use of pharmaceuticals Together they create a poetic sometimes amusing and frequently heartbreaking emotional road trip through an overmedicated misdiagnosed and drug addled America Oscilloscope Pictures

care All this critic s reviews Read full review The A V ClubReviewed by Ignatiy VishnevetskyAug 7 2013 42 Hypocrisy aside Off Label s biggest problem is that for a movie that features a lot of people talking about a lot of things it doesn t have a lot to say its scatterbrained switching between browser tabs structure guarantees that no idea gets developed very far All this critic s reviews Read

very talented You ll enjoy it Expand 1 of 21 users found this helpful BCFdjwx5 9 This review contains spoilers click expand to view This movie was great At first I didn t want to go because I didn t like them but after the movie I love them I love this movie and it s my favorite movie right now Expand 2 of 5 users found this helpful CheckGamesList 7 The movie was not top tier but it was acceptable I ve listened to One Direction s music also not a fan but it s more or less fine but the hate is unnecessary Half of the 49 negative reviews are probably from haters who just gave it zero without watching the movie I also see that some of the people created accounts just to rate this movie a terrible score Expand 1 of 4 users found this helpful PoliSci0621 5 While This Is Us was inspirational charismatic and affirmed that anything can happen it was still incoherent sloppy and without direction no pun intended What makes the film sloppy and incoherent is the fact that much of the scenes are out of place For example one moment you are listening to them in concert and the next you re seeing them on The X Factor Additionally some scenes give off a staged feeling such as when Liam and Harry are talking on the dock Finally it is blatantly obvious by the structure of the film that the studio rushed to get this out there fully knowing that it would make a ton of money Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful skyluxx 2 O this movies has 2 sides the directioner side and the normal man side so this movieon the directioner side is perfect the movie is for teen girls and only they will say it is perfect i had a survey whit my frends whit it so i know and on the regular male side like me the ovie is pure cuz it is just no do not go and watch it if you do not like 1D i can listen to them but no so my score is 2 and that is it directioners can give it a 10000 but it will not help the movie is and that is it Expand 4 of 5 users found this helpful Asgerew 0 This should be in the horror section made me want to run away more than any horror I had ever seen After having to sit through a hour of hell I left wish I hadn t been dragged along to this pile of rubbish Expand 2

will stimulate post screening debates All this critic s reviews Read full review Miami HeraldReviewed by Rene RodriguezAug 29 2013 75 Although there are several stretches in the movie in which Seidl seems to be repeating himself the director is carefully building toward a knock out final scene in which the inscrutable often annoying Anna becomes beautifully poignantly human in front of our eyes like magic All this critic s reviews Read full review EmpireReviewed by Simon CrookAug 14 2013 60 Part two of Ulrich Seidl s Paradise trilogy is a stark morally complex study of blind belief lightened

cheesy and yes sometimes the story line was slightly confusing However I still found this riveting and suspenseful and I would recommend it It s not the best movie I ve EVER seen but it was enjoyable and I really was glad I saw it I ll admit at times I enjoyed it because of Liam Hemsworth s attractiveness but I enjoyed it for the story too Harrison Ford also gave a good performance Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful Movie1997 4 Short sweet and to the point this movie is a movie that takes 0 risk of any stake and can be forgotten within the ride home from the movie theater Be sure to check out my YouTube channel TheMovieManLife for all things movies Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful TVJerry 4 After he s fired from his giant tech company Liam Hemsworth is secretly hired back to spy on their major competitor Predictability ensues The inevitable twists are not surprising You at least expect some slick visuals or neat futuristic stuff Expectations dashed Hensworth makes a generically handsome but bland leading man Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman add some seasoned performances Overall there s nothing about the script that s the least bit new or interesting and the laconic direction never delivers any suspense or wait for it paranoia Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful GreatMartin 2 The main things missing from the thriller Paranoia are thrills The leading man Liam Hemsworth is as good looking as they come and certaintainly Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman as former friends now out to destroy each other play their roles to the hilt Richard Dreyfuss adds the sympathy the only sympathy to the success of Hemsworth who wants it all and Amber Heard supplies the love interest in a role that certainly doesn t give off any thrills as to who will end up together There are a few mysteries in the film such as how does Hemsworth rise so fast showing so little talent in the IT field and just how does Embeth Davidtz fit in as Oldman s right hand The setup and execution of the screenplay by Jason Hall and Berry L Levy is overshadowed by the sights and sounds of all the glass office buildings in Manhattan and the Brooklyn neighborhood Director Robert Luketic keeps the action going with car chases and all kinds of technical gadgets and throws in a red herring that should be easily seen through by even a casual moviegoer Harrison Ford Dreyfus and Davidtz offer whatever tension there is in the movie while Hemsworth Heard various sets and cars offer relaxation for the eyes but Paranoia should disappear quickly from the large screen and go to DVD and the small screen Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful MarkDetrel 2 The idea is good and the cast is good the problem is the next All the movie is really terrible The development is really poor the script is bad and the performances are really terrible Gary Oldman and Harrison Ford do a great job the problem is that the script is so bad and they try to do all the possible to do something good Paranoia is a box of good ideas but poorly executed Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Thegodfatherson 1 But the stakes seem small Director Robert Luketic showed a nice hand at light comedy in Legally Blonde but he has no feel for the tensions of corporate deception The twists aren t surprising the perils feel artificial and even Hemsworth s chest gets a little ho hum after a while The most interesting aspect of Paranoia is the appearance of Oldman and Ford who is looking especially grizzled but hasn t lost that twisted smile of menace They re fun to watch even though the movie s biggest mystery is how they got roped into it Must have had something to do with answering their cellphones Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful var nr domain www metacritic com var nrelate dwparams mapp

french film but Passion was great The plot and the whole idea were really smart Noomi Rapace was something more than excellent and Rachel McAdams was really good too I haven t watched any other Brian de Palma film but as I saw in Passion he must be really good I also liked the cinematography and the whole atmosphere was totally like watching a thriller Though it could have a bigger twist Passion entertains and it will surely make some people feel disturbed A really really good movie with an excellent cast Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful foxgrove 6 Brian DePalma s remake of the French thriller Love Crime is a much glossier affair than its counterpart although not quite as good Containing all of DePalma s usual trademarks Circling and tracking camera movements overhead shots scene dissolves and of course split screen which as presented here is disappointingly rather superfluous The film is also beautifully shot and designed and DePalma has lost none of his skill for drawing the viewer in What the film does lack surprisingly is any really good set pieces which are often the director s piece de resistance The first hour is compulsive viewing as the female protagonists scheme and manipulate ensuring audience intrigue as to where events are going but with the demise of one of the characters the film begins to fall apart and unfortunately it never recovers This is a story weakness because Love Crime also suffered the same problem at the same point but did manage to get back on track for a good ending DePalma presents us with his own special kind of ending that just doesn t work here In fact this final sequence is yet another failed attempt to repeat the Carrie finale which succeeded because it had a genuine shock at its conclusion Interestingly the music used for this final sequence would seem to have been lifted straight out of Dressed to Kill The verdict has to be that whilst this is not vintage DePalma it deserves better than to be shunted out as a Straight to DVD release as has been its fate in the UK Mediocre DePalma is still a lot better than many other director s at the top of their game Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful LamontRaymond 6 I d suggest it s a bit better than the original French film Love Crime mostly because it adds all the DePalma melodrama and camp Noomi is solid and McAdams is really perfect in the role The chief weakness in the film is the boredom surrounding the set up scenes the seemingly unimportant acts that later tie things together I mean sure you have to have those in the movie but you ve got to make the getting there interesting I m still deciding whether I liked the split screen during the ballet sequence I think the dancer was a bit too good looking because she distracts from the other half of the screen which is important Regardless it s not one of DePalma s best but it s fun Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful TVJerry 5 Rachel McAdams Noomi Rapace start out so tight you d think they were lovers but that fondness turns to competition then deception then hate While the plot takes too long to develop and ultimately crumbles the performances are engaging Master director Brian De Palma knows how to craft a compelling story but this one works against him The most notable aspect of this film is the high end polished look slick art direction beautiful design and high glamour women Unfortunately it takes more than that to make a gripping drama Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Dimitris01 3 Boring meaningless movie which lacks a decent plot and tries to attract the

demonstrates how a book adaptation should be making it its own thing while staying loyal to the overall plot of the original story and maintaining continuity with the original film Although some direction was better in the first film overall this film feels more satisfying as an adaptation and feels better as a solid movie overall You do not have to see the first film in order to understand this one Right from the opening scene through a very clever back story prologue and voice over from Percy we get a sense of what is going on in this world and are fully immersed Percy played by Logan Lerman delivers the narration as if he s telling us a legend and one cannot help but feel immersed in the goings on The opening story is intense but is not too dark compared to how other films such as The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian would have handled it On that note the whole film is very family friendly and plays as a light fantasy adventure that nevertheless has its deep morals integrated in Using the Prince Caspian example this film does not go as dark or as intense as that film went yet it also does not go the opposite way in making it campy With that being said there are some weaknesses in the direction of the film While it does not go down the Batman Robin campy road the action of the film feels a little too tame at some parts It s still enjoyable but unfortunately it just doesn t feel completely executed to the point that it should be Its nowhere near bad but it still could have been better The action is still fun to watch but it never gets bloody or as intense as it even was in the first film It plays out as a fun clean fantasy that despite the lack of brutalness it still feels like one could immerse into doing those things should they be real With regards to continuity from the first film you will see a much more expanded Camp Half Blood in the film the home of the main characters however unlike the Harry Potter films it doesn t feel or look as noticeably different The film feels like a sequel and does make the references to the first film but still feels like it can stand on its own While fixing up some cut characters and elements from the first film the film also introduces the goings on at a natural pace without trying to lamely cover things up and consider earlier introduced things as retcon which is more than can be said about Harry Potter which merely puts things in its films without for the most part making any sort of real continuity or grounded connection with the other films choosing instead to make each film stand on its own Sea of Monsters has both a sequel and stand alone feel to it which is how films should be Why should sequels ignore what was previously established in the earlier films The Harry Potters changed pretty much everything to fit the needs of the story without for the most part thinking of new ways to handle the story elements in trying to maintain the books justice While on the note of Harry Potter one simply cannot compare it to any of the Harry Potters Yes there are similarities but being the huge Potter fan that I am I barely thought of Harry while watching this movie There will always be similarities and comparisons but is not every movie comparable to another Even some that people would not even think were similar such as the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy being comparable to the original Star Wars trilogy And let us not forget the Avatar Pocahontas Dances with Wolves or the Iron Man Dark Knight trilogies similarities They will always exist but there will always be one person who has NEVER seen the first film to have the idea and even some who have seen both ideas and may like the newer one that has the old ideas better because of how it is executed Its NOT what it is but HOW it is HOW the movie fixes the first film is in the following ways A much more grounded and more better polished script The first film felt that the script was rushed in and was hopeful to be more than its script The structure and plot was thin and weak and didn t feel as immersed as this film does This film feels like they really revised and mapped out what they wanted from the script instead of just seemingly writing the script over night without revisions You get the sense that the film makers are passionate to get the writing right and make it make sense and enjoyable for those that haven t even seen the first film Percy s friend Grover played by Brandon T Jackson is not annoying in this film like he was in the first film This time he is more mature yet still retains his comic characteristics The world is populated with many characters Unlike the first where there were merely just cameoized characters and small things hidden in the real this one feels more like there actually is a hidden universe Expand 1 of 2 users found this helpful gabrielg 10 I can easily give a 10 beacuse it s BETTER than the first in so many ways that i can t explain in 5000 characters It s

characters are definitely enjoyable to watch Being a avid reader and interested in the books the film was definitely suited for me as were the Harry Potter film franchise Despite finding numerous

this helpful DisneyMovieRev 7 Summary This review took a while to write I was trying to decide whether my casual interest for airplanes was clouding my judgement Then I got confused about whether I was rooting for DisneyToon Studios to succeed or fail in its first theatrical effort in nearly seven years What I came away with was this Planes is a good movie Dusty Crophopper Dane Cook is a crop dusting plane who dreams of racing Besides the fact that he is afraid of heights Dusty is hampered by his lack of speed Still he chases after his dream and through a series of incredibly predictable events he ends up in a race around the world There are some things to dislike about this movie The most obvious is that it starts with a title screen that says From above the world of Cars It s like Disney was shouting We hope you saw that movie because that was really cool This will try to be that but it s going to fail Beyond that there were a few parts that were a little hokey Some say Planes has weak script writing but I think the real weak link is Dane Cook Every time I heard Dusty talk I kept thinking Owen Wilson would have been great in that role Then I remembered that Owen voiced Lightning McQueen the main character in Cars There is no way they would reuse Owen s voice for what is essentially the same role in a movie that is so connected to Cars Still Planes won me over Roper Sinbad and El Chupacabra Carlos Alazraqui were hilarious I liked how Disney showed multiple cultures and gave each its individual identity They even got a Bollywood actress to voice the Indian plane Ishani This is a great movie for kids who wonder when they will ever need Science or Math as the planes constantly talk about gravity drag tail winds and moisture levels It will further bolster arguments that those subjects are good for lots of things You don t need to see Cars before you see this but there are some ties to that movie Planes doesn t have the Radiator Springs emotion of Cars but it tries to make up for that in other ways If you liked cars you will like this Final Verdict I ll let others debate whether this should be a direct to home video film If you have nothing else to do Planes is a solid movie for you to see It gets a solid 7 out of 10 in my mind It doesn t soar to high heights but it doesn t crash and burn Cars was a favorite with kids and I suspect this series will be as well Themes Friendship is the biggest theme Dusty s friendships are strong and he relies on them a lot His friends also rely on him Truth and Honesty play a huge role in the movie as well There is even a slogan about flying for truth And obviously there is the theme of doing more than what you were built to do I don t think they really do enough with this or with Dusty conquering his fear of heights but it s there Disney Nods I m pretty sure there is a hidden Mickey in Dottie s shop I think the Mexico pavilion from EPCOT in Disney World makes an appearance as well And of course there is that blatant title scene designed to tie the movie to Cars Bathroom Break Early in the movie there is a montage where Dusty is being trained for the world race This is a great time to go to the bathroom You ll miss the increase in torque and Dusty s revelation that he s afraid of heights That s the best time If you have to go later there is a time where Chupacabra sings and tries to win someone s heart I found this part to be very entertaining and would hate for you to miss it but when you gotta go you gotta go Credits There is not an ending scene after the credits DisneyToon takes a page from Marvel and reminds us Dusty will return in Planes Fire Rescue Visit www DisneyMovieReview com for more reviews of Disney films Expand 4 of 6 users found this helpful MrEpic012 6 Not As Good As The Cars Movies But It s A Pretty Decent Spin Off And It s Surprising As Well The Animation Is Nice The Story Is Hit Miss The Charters Are Either Funny Or Plain Basic Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful LWFYM 3 I first heard about Planes in late July then I saw a video game tie in to the film then I saw advertisements of toys and other children s items as a tie in to the film then I heard about a sequel Planes Fire and Rescue set for release in 2014 Then the film came out And when I saw the film it was crap There is always some type of thing in every Disney film I ve seen that just grips you and sometimes leaving you with a sense of satisfaction this film does not have that It seems like the whole purpose of this film is to make a franchise off of it for profit The animation says Disney the story is very cliche and the characters have personalities that you can find in any other underdog film Kids will drag their parents to see it have a good time and enjoy it I know that much But overall this film is nothing but something to keep you occupied for 92 minutes Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Thegodfatherson 2 At the end of the day Planes is passable direct to video animated entertainment for kids featuring action sequences that are more cinematic in their style but the movie doesn t deserve a theatrical release when viewed as a whole No doubt many young moviegoers will still enjoy large segments of the film especially if they see it in 3D which may well be reason enough for some families to give it a look Regardless it s difficult to ignore how Planes ends up feeling like little more than an often dull and nearly soulless cash grab Expand 3 of 6 users found this helpful hoops2448 1 Much like Cars Planes isn t firing on all cylinders It s a direct to DVD feature that was upgraded to fill a release gap a gap most people are currently wishing had stayed vacant Crop Duster Dusty Crophopper Dane Cook is sick of being a one job plane Dusty wants to be a racer and with the help of his mentor Skipper Stacy Keach and a little luck he might just get to do what he wants While it does try to at least make sense from a story point of view it doesn t mean its a good film If all you want to do is make a story that makes sense you haven t really set the bar very high However the director pretends that s all he needs and carries on regardless in the search for something that can scrape the bottom of average It doesn t While the ride works its bumpy cringe worthy and unoriginal a trifecta of awfulness that added together makes Planes a horrific viewing experience Dane Cook is surprisingly not offensive but the whole film is it insults peoples intelligence as we are forced to watch Cars again Expand 2 of 3 users found this helpful sherbypaladin 0 Hollywood propaganda machine to its finest A movie glorifying the military the veterans the middle class and classic all american values Where s Hollywood imagination They re feeding ketchup to those kids always the same ol sauce Seriously it was obvious that the only countries present in the race were the US allies during Iraq part II Canada Mexico Brazil etc France was nowhere to be seen With such a thin story what are we putting in our kid s heads This story is the same story with a few variants that we ve seen over and over A good spoonful of sauce carefully cooked by the sociologists psychologists and think tanks of Washington D C and Hollywood is there any difference If I were you I would seriously avoid this movie and all others like this one Feed your kid with some

whimsical yet adult French comedy with enough going on beneath the surface to make watching it unique despite its similarities to other French films most notably 2011 s Romantics Anonymous Populaire tells the story of Rose Deborah Francois a young French woman who moves from her small village life to the hustle and bustle of the big city in 1959 to become a secretary a job she finds difficult and to avoid getting fired she agrees to take part in a typing competition something that may bring Rose and her boss Louis Romain Duris closer While not as polished and delightful as Amelie or the aforementioned Romantics Anonymous Populaire does charm you from beginning to end thanks to its three fantastic lead performances by Francois Duris and Bernice Bejo as Louis old friend and ex lover Most of the credit goes to Francois who manages to make her often childish character realistic and moving thanks to her ability to read the subtleties of a scene She manages to be quirky and adult at the same time an admirable feat The scripting is clever as it incorporates the idea of a society still recovering from the devastation of the war almost 15 years on as well as the the desire to modernise something we are still feeling today The film uses the war to add colour to its characters especially Louis who unlike the conventional war veteran has no fear of what he saw just everything waiting for him back home especially Marie Bejo It s a rose tinted film so it does turn a bit saccharine towards the end but it is to be expected from a French film about love it has to end well Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful foxgrove 6 A throwback to the Rock Hudson and Doris Day comedies of the 50 s this is a light and frothy French concoction that washes over you There is a good period feel but the best parts are the actual typing competitions which are very entertainingly filmed with real zing The camera movement for these sequences even manages to evoke mild tension Sadly any other emotion is lacking from the rest of the film It s also way too long Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful var nr domain www metacritic com var nrelate dwparams mapp nrelate comptype widget

using a ton of name brand actors it has almost no hollywoodisms to an uncomfortable degree It feels so real that it s difficult to watch One of the tensest things I ve ever seen Beyond being a great thriller it also engages with larger issues that have been touched on in previous films like Zero Dark Thirty and Munich namely even if justified what damage does vengeance or torture do to us as a society when we carry them out Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful KittyClose 10 Interesting dark story Great characters Excellent casting I came away from the theater wanting to know background stories about each of the main characters Somehow I had to explain the whole story to another woman who sat near me She came away not understanding anything that happened and was shocked when I explained it to her She said it sounded like I saw a different film than she did I guess not every movie is for every viewer Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful MovieGoer14 10 Prisoners is a deep dark film with a first rate cinematography breathtaking performances riveting editing incredible dialog and pretty much one of the best movies of all year What makes this movie distinctive is the opening silent sequence the atmosphere its self it is chilling and a gripping thriller it is a tense talk film that kept me at the edge of my seat It is maybe the best performance ever coming from Hugh Jackman he is magnificent in this movie the villains and the good ones everyone in this movie has something wrong with them and this is one of the things that I loved in this film Prisoners is one of the best movies all year and highly recommended I loved Prisoners Expand 9 of 9 users found this helpful Compi24 9 It may be a complete gut punch of a movie at times but that s the entire

plot has some holes but so what Entertaining albeit a tad predictable Hugh Jackman is very believable in his role Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful jeremyp 8 It s a long movie but an engrossing one The first half of the movie seems to be a metaphor for Guantanamo Impotent rage leads to torture and possibly justice but definitely injustice And at what cost Scattered clues lead if read correctly to the inevitable truth about the kidnapping of the girls but leave open to interpretation the moral paths taken and the outcome of a major protagonist The audience is manipulated hither thither and yon and it s all great fun if you stay objective and quite teeth grinding if you don t The Director borrows heavily from many sources these days who doesn t and who can t and it s quite a Pot Pourri of memory lane goodies The last shot seems to be leaving us with an open ended question You decide Jackman is great as a very loose cannon Wolverine was a warmup Gyllenhall is all ticks and props and gimmicks Dano is paid well for a mute and Maria Bello is oh so wasted Of course SPOILER there is one actor who is in this for an oh so obvious reason Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful amysusername 1 I absolutely hated this movie Judging by the critic reviews it only got a high score from them because it s pretty and the style is interesting I m still trying to wrap my head around the fact that all the user scores are so high I will admit that it s a visually pleasing movie but not only does the mediocre plot drag on forever it also relies on cheap tricks like the plot twist near the end and doesn t fill the expectations built up in the trailer the truth behind the story was completely unbelievable And even though most people seem to think the characters are well thought through all I saw was tropes Hugh Jackman s character is the ruthless badass who d do anything to protect his child his wife is a stereotypical mother doing nothing but crying for her lost child Detective Loki is the excellent detective with no social life and the villains are your cookie cutter Hollywood serial killers Joy s parents seemed to be the only characters who weren t one

this movie to come to be I am very happy Vin placed his very home on the line to help fund the movie why it may have not be as big and going to as many different locations as past movies The fact that studios did not want to make another movie However the team pulled it off its fun action pack not to over the top and a little bit different feel as well I hope I will be able to see the final two movies they have plan to finish up the tale Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful JPG127 9 Caution if you don t like action sci fi or any of the other Riddick movies then your not going to like this If you did then this is a great follow up Good pacing good action more then just the previews and good acting Also it was funny at times Which was a pleasant surprise Expand 3 of 3 users found this helpful atc dp 8 Fun and funny this movie was overflowing with all the badass goodness you ve come to appreciate about Riddick If you didn t like either of the previous films then by all means don t waste your time or anyone else s However if you can appreciate the overwhelming badass scifi machismo that is Riddick then don t delay and get to the theaters NOW Expand 0 of 0 users found this

it is well done in an era where 30 million for a movie is considered low budget Bottom line Give it a chance Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful hendraone 6 I ve seen the movie and i think Riddick is trying to go back to the root just like the pitch black i love the concept where Riddick abandoned and trying to survive but the creatures they are too easy to beat kinda boring after we know that Riddick can beat them all and the mercenaries cmon too much corny joke from my opinion the jokes kinda ruin the movie but overall its worth to watch Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Kevlar1 0 What a sham I watched till the end just to see the level of disgrace V D was gonna fall to I was wondering all the way whether the writer director enjoyed what he did I m not going to give away spoilers because Riddick producers did everything to already spoil everything they could but ANY schoolboy would ve come up with a much better plot devices witty lines action scenes There is no fun there is no action it s pretentious and BORING The highest point of the story is killing the ugly doggy facepalm As for exalting reviews well it s because of that false enthusiasm we re getting lousy phoney movies in spades Studios don t have to worry about illegal downloading anymore cause there is nothing to download these days let alone buy some Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful See all 68

10 What an amazing movie about to legends of the track Niki Lauda is a machine unbelievable driver and technician and James Hunt just pure raw talent Chris Hemsworth Daniel Br hl do them both justice such a enjoyable movie well filmed really intense action just one of them all round completely brilliant films a must see Expand 7 of 8 users found this helpful alex2542 10 This review contains spoilers click expand to view Probably the best movie I ve seen this year not saying too much this year And I m not even a huge F1 fan I went into this expecting it to be a run of the mill racing film and wasn t expecting much from Hemsworth Man was I wrong Hemsworth delivers his best performance so far the drama is genuine the action is truly thrilling It s a bit of a puff piece at times but not in a way that makes me roll my eyes The part where Lauda returns to the track after his injury and finishes in fourth gave me genuine chills for the entire scene I can t say how much I respect that about people When they have a genuine passion for something and will do whatever it takes to continue doing what they love for all the things I hate about people this is something I truly respect Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Phascedph 10 This is an amazing film I can t recommend it highly enough for F1 fans like me sports fans or anyone interested in a story of rivalry i e something different to the unoriginal junk movies which get churned out each year All the crew involved should pat themselves on the back They ve done a fabulous job making this film critique explore and honour two memorable F1 drivers James Hunt s fun party lifestyle along with his brash and raw driving talent This is contrasted against Niki Lauda s methodical thinking technical brilliance and professional lifestyle These two characters are total opposites but as their lives are explored it also acknowledges the value of an enemy i e something to beat I believe this is a commentary on human nature in that the best of us shines when we have something to beat or overcome Do yourself a favour and see it now Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful man 9 Another tremendous effort from director Ron Howard This is quite simply one of this year s finest films I don t know a whole lot about Formula One racing but the premise of the film immediately sounded very entertaining The race sequences were all highly impressive and entertaining and were also expertly filmed The film s story line also had excellent pacing despite a few scenes and races seeming a bit rushed no pun intended Another one of the film s greatest aspects were the powerful performances from both of the leads Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl had great chemistry together onscreen and their engaging rivalry made me all the more anxious to see how things would turn out for the two of them They were one of the main reasons for making this great experience all the worthwhile To sum it up definitely this year s best onscreen racing experience and among one of this year s best films overall Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful kevtheobald 9 Ron Howard invested his own money and made this film without studio support because he believed there was a great story here and he was right Howard is known for great directing and this shows in this film I have seen some comments about how they used old race footage but they should know the recreated most of what you see on the screen It is amazing the attention to detail Howard and his crew did when making this film I wish I could say I know the historical details to tell you how much is Hollywood fluff and how much is real but I will say so far this seems very accurate It is a based on a true story and do mean more then just 5 of it is based on a true story like some movies The acting was good overall Not only was the casting good but the attention to detail with clothing sets cars etc is top notch They did a great job creating that 1970s vibe I appreciate that they did not not drag out the racing scenes This is movie is about the people not the cars The racing scenes are very well done but movie really does focus on the characters Many automotive based movies become super cheesy but Howard did a good job keeping it under control There are few times is bordered on crossing the line Yes if you hate hearing the F word or seeing people use the middle finger this film may offend you Unlike movies who seem to use harsh language for no reason this feels like how they really would have spoken You will see short moments bare butts and breasts but none of it us vulgar If you are looking for a good drama with some action this is a great movie If you enjoy racing and do not know this story you must see this movie If you want to see the movie industry make a wider range of movies then see this movie because no studio would have made this If Ron Howard shows there is a market for more than popcorn and horror movies then we may see more quality films of this level come out Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Compi24 8 With a crackling script from Peter Morgan a stylishly invigorating directorial turn from Ron Howard and two superb performances from Hemsworth and Bruhl Rush easily proves its worth as probably the most notable nonfiction sports chronicle this side of The Fighter Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful

bright I was in a somber mood and quiet was the day that I broke into the tears A MUST SEE FILM Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful MarcDoyle 9 Extremely well written film This story has been told 100 times but not nearly as elegantly as this time And the two leads are simply outstanding It would be a shame if Brie Larson isn t mentioned for her performance come award season Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful PieceofMine 9 Writer director Destin Cretton s Short Term 12 is a marvel an intimate look into the life of a young woman named Grace a mature resourceful and damaged caretaker at a juvenile housing facility From first shot to last the film is stunning it is emotionally vast beautifully and intimately shot and an incredibly acted success Short Term 12 s subject matter lends itself to immediacy and so the film presents its characters in stride building up Grace her paramour co worker ally and confidant Mason and the teenagers in their care with small detailed brushstrokes for example we learn who Mason is primarily through his natural storytelling ability as he introduces the facility to a new staff member with anger brimming older boy Marcus it s a profound but not unbelievably polished rap session These moments are expository without ever feeling forced or out of place Cretton s mantra seems to favor an almost voyeuristic naturalism above all else There are a few scant moments where the writing takes a turn for the more forced especially when the script plays for laughs and the jokes stand out from the rest of the dialogue because they are so obviously structured for punchlines These are easily forgiven however as the film quickly slips into its deeply sympathetic stages teasing out the wracking pain and broken pasts buried within these kids who quickly demonstrate that they re far more than the band of colorful misfits they initially present as The aforementioned Marcus as the facility s veteran resident and a newcomer Jayden whose attitude and scarred over past most closely resemble Grace play the primary fulcrums for Mason and Grace to pivot around Instead of one great urgency that drives the narrative forward there is a looser short story style that weaves its way through the film thus adhering to its dropped in naturalistic feel The conflicts these kids and other adults introduce and the sympathies they engender are utilized as ways to explore primarily Grace s own frustrations weaknesses aspirations and pain Grace is the all encompassing center stage here and at its core the film is very introspective an elegant psychological portrait that strikes a near perfect balance between what it shows and what it leaves for the viewer to surmise So of course we must talk about Brie Larson s superlative sumptuous performance as Grace This is as close of an embodiment of the now mythical strong female character as you re likely to see all year She s immediately admirable and likable it s clear that she cares for these children and operates with a generous compassion and patience but her balancing flaws are what make her truly stand out Instead of a few individual negative traits like the general impishness that infects every manic pixie dream girl derivative or say emotional volatility because you know women are crazy her demons form an almost terrifying certainly tragically cohesive whole She s constantly receding from some past open wound and it makes her at times prideful stubborn defiant pitiful and difficult Her past and her person come together to form a character that understands how to fight through pain and demonstrates courage through her resilience and fire but is never quite sanctified and all the more laudably grounded for it Though in broad strokes it is a rich and comprehensive and powerful portrayal there are a few pinprick moments where the direction does seem to recede into comfortable cliche do we ever need another shot of a character looking vacant and troubled in the shower Still a few of these are easily forgiven and the larger picture painted is still breathtaking This centerpiece that is Grace owes equal dues to Cretton s heartfelt script and Larson s performance the latter of which runs the gamut between optimistically aloof passionate distant angry and when earned triumphant and she leaves nothing on the table Larson would stick out like a sore thumb however if her supporting cast didn t all rise to the challenge to extend the tapestry of her character into a fully realized world populated with all sorts of interesting As Mason John Gallager Jr gives a far less showy but quietly stellar performance as Grace s partner in all things if I had to nitpick there are moments where he suffers from Gary Stu syndrome but he has enough to do to quickly rise up as a formidably substantial character on his own When Grace runs into adversaries instead of being heartless bureaucratic hardasses like the DMV caricatures administrative types are usually presented as they offer counter arguments that are both logical and passionate and Grace is far from always right But we continue to root for her in tremendous ways because she seems so knowable because she s heartwrenchingly thorough because this story in spite of its sometimes angsty trappings comes across as so personal and real Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful netflic 9 This is Destin Cretton s second movie as a Director and a Writer And I would say a very impressive one The movie is about life in a facility for teenagers from abusive families It focuses on kids who live there and stuff who work there I found the movie incredibly honest and delicate Very strong acting performance Brie Larson who plays Grace in my opinion deserves to be nominated for Oscar Overall it is an excellent movie Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful BHBarry 8 Short Term 12 stars Brie Larson and John Gallagher Jr NewsroomJ in this beautiful and sensitive film written and directed by Destin Cretetton It has been my viewing experience that in most instances when the writer is also the director of the film the movie tends to be too long and improperly edited since the creator can t seem to delete and take out the unnecessary footage for fear of hurting his or her work Objectivity usually is replaced by sentiment and loyalty to the original product regardless of its effect on the audience Mr Cretton proved that the opposite can be true for this film is wonderfully edited and plays out smooth as silk as it tells the tale of staffers in a foster care facility and the problems they experience with their teen age wards It should be noted that Mr Cretton worked in such a facility so there is legitimacy and honesty in his writing about it There are subplots and small divergences which make for an interesting cinema experience Ms Larson is a talented actress with natural beauty and ability and the script affords her the opportunity to utilize her thespian skills so that you are ab e tp identify with her and the difficulties in her life In spite of all of the travails facing these workers and wards the movie is uplifting and gives us all hope and the ability to believe that no one is beyond help and redemption I enthusiastically recommend it and give the film an 8 rating Watch for some of the cast to be mentioned when Oscar time rolls around because there are performances in this film you will remember for a long time to come Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful canhenha 8 Short Term 12 is a film that could have fallen easily into the movie of the week context with the dramas of child abuse however director Destin Cretton wisely chooses to follow Grace a young woman who has survived difficult ordeals and who wants to provide help and guidance for the children The film allows for these characters to fully live and have dimension and much of it s core and heart comes from the interaction of the actors The director is also very successful in capturing the frailty of children s lives and expectations as is in the way it captures the hardship of a young relationship and the steps to becoming a responsible adult The threads that the film successfully builds are as delicate as they are strong in it s emotional impact Brie Larson has a fantastic performance as the experienced yet frail Grace as does Kaitlyn Dever as the young Jayden The film also benefits from the beautiful cinematography from Brett Pawlak A great film not to be missed Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful var nr domain www metacritic com var nrelate dwparams mapp

grown famous for stirring ordinary people to shed their nine to five existence and act on their dreams Spark takes us behind the curtain with Burning Man organizers and participants revealing a year of unprecedented challenges and growth When ideals of a new world based on freedom and inclusion collide with realities of the default world we wonder which dreams can survive Expand Director Jessie

reviews Read full review The A V ClubReviewed by Jesse HassengerAug 21 2013 75 There are times when the slight small Sparrows Dance pushes too hard both visually and narratively a blinking red light outside Ireland s window provides overly fussy on off lighting during two long scenes and the movie s flairs of serious conflict are less deft than its offhand moments of connection There are enough of said moments though to sustain its sweetly hesitant romance All this publication s reviews Read full review The New York TimesReviewed by Jeannette CatsoulisAug 22 2013 70 Mr Buschel armed with an

realistic to the struggles people deal with in sex addiction and what the recovery process looks like Mark Ruffalo plays it genuinely and understatedly I think Gwyneth Paltrow as Phoebe was my favorite there are some very racey scenes with her and Mark Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful richardsnewsong 9 There is a lot to like about this movie Great performances by Mark Ruffalo Tim Robbins Josh Gad and Pink put a very human face on the different stages of dealing with the the real life tragedy of sex and love addiction I consider this a wonderful feel good movie that has a broad range of emotions both comic and tragic and the producers took a big risk to focus on a subject matter sex and love addiction that is likely to make a portion of the movie going audience to uncomfortable I wish this movie well There is a lot to laugh about in this movie but this movie is more than a comedy There is plenty of drama in this movie also and I found myself alternately laughing and crying as I found myself connecting and caring about the characters and hoping for good outcomes Joely Richardson plays Monica the long suffering wife of Mike Tim Robbins a alcoholic sex addict with 15 years of sobriety and unfortunately there is not enough time in a 2 hour movie to flesh out her character Clearly Mike Tim Robbins has made his life of recovery a big part of his life what is sometimes called a bleeding deacon and the relationship between Monica Joely Richardson and Mike seems harmonious until their addict son Danny Patrick Fugit returns home and the tension between a Mom and Dad dealing with their out of control son takes it s toll Enter Adam Mark Ruffalo a sex addict with 5 years of sobriety who is sponsored by Mike and ready to start dating again after choosing total abstinence to get his addiction under control The great lengths Adam goes to in achieving sobriety seems rather ridiculous unless you realize the powerful nature of addiction which is the subject of a later portion of the movie and some of Ruffalo s best work you feel his pain Enter Phoebe Gyneth Paltrow as Adam s new love interest Phoebe is a cancer survivor who has a compulsive relationship with food and fitness and the primary focus of their growing love centers on Adam s deep fear about revealing his history of addiction and losing Phoebe The movie made me care about Adam and Phoebe both hoping for a good outcome and a happy ending I credit the writer s for taking us on some unexpected twists and turns that serve to highlight the reality of the disease of sex and love addiction Josh Gad is the comic relief in the move His character Neil is a young ER Doctor in the early stages of recovery from sex addiction and the movie takes a sympathetic look at the challenges and slips of making big changes in life to achieve sobriety Neil is like a lot of sex addicts in early recovery not taking it seriously until his addiction costs him his job Pink is a scene stealer as Dede a female sex addict also going through the torment of early recovery from sex and love addiction yes it happens to females too The growing friendship between Neil and Dede is another element where you really care how things will turn out OK the movie is far from perfect Some might see the Paltrow character as shallow but that is the point she is a total control freak dealing with her own demons and the attraction between Adam and Phoebe makes sense as they are both finding a mirror into dealing with their own issues Will they stay or will they run The drama and tension around Mike Monica and Danny seems somewhat contrived and I attribute that to the movie choosing to deal with deep topics and attempting to wrap things up in less then 2 hours So yes I like this movie I like this movie a lot I will confess my bias I am a sex and love addiction professional and my only stake in this is that I hope the movie will succeed enough that it will allow others in the movie industry to take risks like this to entertain and educate us in the sense that the movie handles this controversial movie topic with sympathy humor and accuracy in depicting the disease and the road to recovery And at the end of the day I left this movie entertained I laughed a lot I got choked up and cried I applauded endings that were not totally cliche and yet offered hope for a brighter tomorrow Go see this movie Go see this movie with someone you love and care about It will open you up and make you feel Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful TVJerry 6 The trailer for this film is one of the most misleading in recent memory It looks like a smart comedy about sex addiction Bit the ONLY amusing scenes are in that trailer The rest of this film is all drama as it follows 4 addicts Mark Ruffalo Tim Robbins Josh Gad Pink in various stages of recovery They struggle with each other and their personal relationships in predictable patterns The performances are strong Pink was a revelation which makes the rather pedestrian script a bit more bearable Still this almost feels like a recruitment video examination of the addiction Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful GreatMartin 6 Thanks For Sharing is a film about addiction sex addiction When the film opens we meet Adam Mark Ruffalo who has 5 years of recovery hi his sponsor Mike Tim Robbins and Neil Josh Gad who is court ordered to attend the sessions but doesn t take it seriously until he loses his job as an ER medic Neil has problems with his mother Roberta Carol Kane while Mike s son Danny Patrick Fugit was a drug addict who was treated badly by his father when he was young and Mike s wife Monica Joely Richardson has learned how to deal with her husband s problems by concentrating on herself The film revolves around three couples from the long married Mike and Monica to Adam ready to have his long purposely delayed sexual experience after meeting Phoebe Gwyneth Paltrow and the friendship between Neil and Dede Alecia Moore aka Pink the latter wilder than any of the men As in any film about addiction there are victories and defeats though in Thanks For Sharing there are more of the former The scenes involving Tim Robbins Joely Richardson and Patrick Fugit especially those between the two men are full of electric Josh Gad and Alecia Moore offer the comedy relief with both doing excellent work The first scene of Ruffalo with his shirt off brings back the 50s and 60s when actors like William Holden has to shave their chests of all hair obviously that rule doesn t apply anymore Ruffalo gives a warm sensitive performance while Paltrow as a cancer survivor comes across as cold and unfeeling with the role begging for a warm girl next door actress By the way the film Academy may have to give an Oscar for the actress who gives the best lap dance and strip show if there are any more in addition to Paltrow here and Jennifer Aniston in We re The Millers right now Aniston wins With a screenplay by Stuart Blumberg who also directed and Matt Winston Thanks For Sharing really doesn t bring anything new to an addiction story except here it is about sex instead of drugs and or alcohol so there are more sexual situations shown Mark Ruffalo Tim Robbins Josh Gad Patrick Fugit and Alecia Moore all do excellent work and hold your interest as does the photography of New York City by Yaron Orbach Expand 0

ridiculous This movie is a rare beast a quality science fiction survival horror Yes a quality one The cast is impressive and the acting is really good Laurence Fishburne did well for sure The movie has some beautiful scenery and the setting frozen Earth and the plot is solid enough Sure for science fiction it has some flaws for example footprints hold during the night on the snow despite the never ending blizzard Or the certain tribe is so big it shouldn t be able to survive taking into account their ration But that s about it I can t recall any other major problem and I saw this movie just yesterday Besides this is the fourth post apocalyptic movie of 2013 that I have seen The Oblivion was obviously the best hands down And this is also the simple fact that After Earth was obviously the worst Taking into account their budgets I would say The Colony is no worse than World War Z There is no unnecessary pathos and its characters definitely has more depth and creates more of viewers willingness to empathize them Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful MamaTLF 5 The idea for the story is good the twist in the story excellent and cast promising But the plot development has flaws in logic that turns the story on a path full of unnecessary events and character development That coupled with naive last half of the movie and the ending that seemed rushed with no explanation the movie is just a shell of what it was supposed to be Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful var nr domain www metacritic com var nrelate dwparams mapp nrelate comptype widget comp 380 riaevent view s6

of meaning The New York Times Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Troianman 9 I enjoyed this movie a great deal Though it should be stated up front that this particular movie is in a very different style than the previous movie depicting the life of Ip Man and that it takes a few liberties with his story for the sake of a major portion of the plot The majority of fight scenes were choreographed as if two opponents were dancing on a stage and just as beautiful to watch The pacing might be a bit slow for some audiences but lets be honest that isn t the audience this movie is going for with its incredibly artful approach and major emphasis on story instead of just endless fights for no reason so the pacing argument doesn t really hold much weight Virtually the only complaint I had after walking out of the theater was that there were some scenes which seemed unfinished or like something else was meant to be there but was obviously not After looking into this I quickly discovered that it is because there was actually something else there in other versions American audiences are receiving a version that is about 20 minutes shorter than the cut shown to other audiences and that 20 minutes is all story that is missing So while the version in America suffers from unfortunate editing it seems that the full version director s cut international version whatever you want to call it likely does not Of course the only way to confirm this will be to wait until the DVD Blu Ray release which will hopefully be a director s cut Even without those 20 minutes it is incredibly satisfying to watch and I would completely recommend this movie to anybody even remotely interested Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful lasttimeisaw 7 As film buffs are all acclimatized with the fact that every Kar Wai Wong s project has to endure an excruciatingly procrastinated process of f filming and editing since IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE 2000 9 10 an almost six year gap between THE GRANDMASTER and his first misfired Hollywood foray MY BLUEBERRY NIGHT 2007 8 10 does manifest Wong s perverse assiduity and forbearance on his own artifact apart from the sporadic but stretching out shooting spells Wong is also universally distinguished for other idiosyncrasies such as script less improvisations for his cast the stylish oriental aesthetics dramatized by the over sentimental score larger than life characters uttering aphorisms with philosophic undertones and last but not the least the cinematography brimful of vim and vigor on this occasion Philippe Le Sourd is the new DP I ve been consistently vouching for Wong simply because he is my favorite Hong Kong director albeit his perceptible slump of his career orbit in the noughties even his less successful esoteric saga tale 2046 2004 9 10 has won me over without a hitch THE GRANDMASTER reunites Tony Leung and Ziyi Zhang as rivals cum mutual attracted contemporaries Kung Fu masters Ip Man and Gong Er spanning over 50 years in the tumultuous southern China from the beginning of 20th Century despite of its 130 minutes length I watched the Chinese theatrical version the film somewhat stymies its audiences from getting a comprehensive grip on Ip Man the nominal protagonist instead it leans heavily on the plot of Gong Er s obstinate revenge for her father s demise maybe Chinese viewers have already fed up with a plethora of Ip Man on screen notably Donnie Yen s Ip Man series so this approach lends Ziyi Zhang a rare platform to outshine Tony Leung in rendering a meatier portraiture of a woman s fortitude and pluck in the male dominant Kung Fu m tier The dazzling action sequences are scattered wantonly among Wong s slow paced micro distant frames zero in his players amber countenances the opening fight manages to achieve an ultra clarity of splashing raindrops in the Stygian night and the subsequent ones are all meticulously shot with slow motion interactions and two thumbs up for all the actors name checking Tong Leung Ziyi Zhang Max Zhang and Chen Chang for their strenuous endeavor in their martial arts training While Japanese composer Shigeru Umebayashi continues his collaboration with Wong Stefano Lentini s adaption of soprano piece Stabat Mater imprints on one s mind profoundly in this otherwise over scored Kung Fu spectacle My first viewing may fall short below my much hyped anticipation the disjointed narrative most obtrusively is the largely subtracted subplot of Chen Chang s Yi Xian Tian and underdevelopment of Ip Man s own storyline cast a shadow in Wong s latest offering one might compulsively wonder who is the real grandmaster here the taciturnly suave Ip Man or the intrepidly determined Gong Er Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful netflic 5 It is a movie about Yip Man Chineese martial arts master who trained Bruce Lee If I had to characterize the movie in one word I would pick eclectic It is a movie about a real person but not docu drama It is an action movie but quite slow most of time It is very artsy but not consistently and sometimes lacking taste Some episodes are just weird Overall it did not appeal to me Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful JoshEyre 4 I was expecting a lot more with both the critic and user reviews but people are obviously still drawing some smokey parallels between the artistry of both film and story of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon to movies like The Grandmaster Let s just say that The Grandmaster is stuffed full of slow motion kung fu choreography and long glances between Ip Man and Lady Gong but it s less of a film than empty kung fu porn interspersed with a vignette of family revenge Ip Man isn t really a character in this movie but an avatar to join the kung fu porn from scene to scene Then he disappears for nearly half of the movie so Lady Gong can do her thing So calling this movie The Grandmaster is problematic because the only coherent story in this film isn t really about Ip Man or even the Old Grand Master but his daughter rescuing the honor of her family from the punk who her father the old Grand Master gave his fighting legacy to Ip Man s story in the movie is so lightweight that it feels secondary if even a story at all In the end you leave wondering what the point of the movie was at all Now movies don t always have to have some super precise and epic story but we are supposed to care about the path that Ip Man took to Grandmaster at least that s what I thought was the point and the writers spent barely any part of the movie telling that story in anywhere near an effective manner Ip Man was underdeveloped The love story was underdeveloped The history was not woven into the story effectively I love artistically executed films but Wong Kar Wai has become a master of style over substance This movie tries to do 2 things that could have their own story one of Ip Man s path to Hong Kong and the other of Lady Gong s quest to recover her father s legacy It only tells one of these stories decently Gong s and the other it completely fails So we basically have a 2 hour movie with about 30 minutes that really grabs you This is not a good movie Don t let the decent score fool you Everyone who I went to see the movie with agreed If you want to see a movie about Ip Man see Ip Man If you want to see a beautiful kung fu movie see Crouching Tiger The Grandmaster is chaff Expand 0 of 0 users found this

the is the razor this guy gets some screen that time doesnt mesh into the main story GOng er doesnt even get a rematch with IP man who s got to be most boring protagonist I ve ever watched There s a

don t know what all of these critics were watching but I would see this movie 10 times over It was AMAZING So worth it Expand 1 of 4 users found this helpful awesomeness274 10 I loved it and I read the book I thought everything was great the set the props the acting and the cast The plot might of be iffy with Valentine but I think if everyone tries hard in the next movie to make it as close to the book as they can it will turn out great This is not another Twilight romance Twilight was a romance story this is a full on story and like any other good book has some romance in it A lot of the big critics are just sick of seeing fantasy movies well get over it because fantasy and sci fi will never stop with teens and tweens Expand 3 of 5 users found this helpful Pattz25 10 A great book to movie adaptation of an already much loved book series The cast is amazing and so is the plot which has no more than a few changes to it compared to the book Expand 8 of 12 users found this helpful Paula97 9 I was satisfied with the adaptation as a fan of the books I had my hopes a little up I liked it very much and I am looking forward for a sequel though I am hoping they improve one thing or more I was a little disappointed by some of the cast performances specially Magnus Bane So again I really liked this movie and I really hope they continue the series and if they do I hope they make the next movies better P S Please forgive my english Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful Danniquima 7 The movie it s entertaining it got holes in the storyline and its a little bit different to the book However its not something that we haven t seen before but its enjoyable and you will have a good time watching it And besides it s a movie for the youngest people for the fans of the books not for an Academy Award Expand 7 of 10 users found this helpful Movie1997 4 I know people don t want to hear this but lets the facts it s a combination of Twilight Harry Potter and possibly other books series that you might have loved There s nothing new here it s just the next big teen movie If your a girl and love Twilight then you ll absolutely adore this movie If you re like me and were disappointed with its lack of originality then you ll probably hate this movie Overall it s from book series that you ve read before Be sure to check out my YouTube channel TheMovieManLife Expand 1 of 2 users found this helpful AlexProductions 0 I went in to City of Bones thinking it was going to be a terrible movie but it turns out I was wrong it was worse Before we get too far into the review I will say that I have not read any of the books so there will be no comparison at all in this review The film straight out rips off Twilight Harry Potter and Buffy the Vampire Slayer all at the same time You would think that with all these good ideas already existing they could put together a pretty good movie but I found myself already tired ten minutes in with another 90 minutes to go City of Bones is the story of Clarissa Fray Lily Collins who learns that she has special powers and is a shadowhunter She meets Jace Jamie Bower who has a British accent and together they fight monsters in New York that only they can see It s impossible not to see Twilight in this film because there are just so many similarities A couple hours ago I checked the Rotten Tomatoes score of the film and it reminded me of MySpace A couple years ago it would ve been hot but today no one likes it or should see it Mortal Instruments City of Bones was just cheap Cheap special effects that weren t impressive cheap acting and a lot of extra false drama incorporated into the film For example there was a scene within a few minutes of the start where Clary s mom picked up a creepy note on the table and the whole family freaked out like three times slower than a regular persons reaction From that time through the rest of the movie I felt like I was watching a bad soap opera The romance felt fake and was at the most random times Since Twilight had romance this film had to have a poor copy of romance too I mean seriously at least Twilight s romance was more convincing and made sense Oh and by the way Jace was also in all three Twilights and Harry Potter REALLY When I found this out it reminded me one of those shows where the employee works at their competitors company so they will get all the secrets Except it didn t help City of Bones was still crap With the colon in the title it hints the production of another film in the series which kills me Hopefully viewers will know the quality of this film and won t waste money with the next installment I felt like this movie belonged more on Nickelodeon then on the big screen With no originality false drama bad acting even worse special effects and soap opera qualities it s a no brainer that City of Bones is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and will obviously not be recommended Expand 4 of 5 users found this helpful See all

Thegodfatherson 10 But up until its final minutes The World s End is a genuine delight the most satisfying apocalypse of a summer that has been brimming with them Robert Frost famously mused Some say the world will end in fire Some say in ice I prefer Edgar Wright s vision It will end in a pub Expand 6 of 6 users found this helpful AlejandroCausor 10 Is amazing A genuine and satisfaying apocalypse of Wright The humor is very intelligent is a movie made by fans for fans Simon Pegg Nick Frost and Edgar Wright has been one of the biggest success stories of cinema of the last decade Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful MattCipolla926 10 This is by far the funniest and most fun movie of the year everyone involved is as good as ever Honestly this is a movie made by fans for fans and the entire theater loved it I got to see this at a Cornetto Trilogy marathon comprised of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz leading up to the 10 00 PM premiere of the film and EVERYONE had an incredible time Everyone First thing s first is a comedy so is it funny FROM START TO FINISH And surprisingly it s actually very heartfelt The characters are very likable even if they re rude and belligerent they have a good side to them and there is an argument between Simon Pegg and Nick Frost towards the end that was actually very moving This film never sacrifices a character or plot point to make a joke just like the other films in this trilogy and that in itself shows the care here A lot of movies are just mindless fun but this is actually smart and it in turn makes it so much more fun Edgar Wright s timing and ability to create terrific fight scenes are as good as ever and of course Simon Pegg Nick Frost and all others are just fantastic And let me say something these special effects are stellar throughout and it only cost 20 million Truly well spent I just can t wait to see this again And note I am not comparing this to Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz which are my two favorite comedies of all time because each entry in the Cornetto Trilogy is so different and all of them are truly exceptional 9 6 10 amazing two thumbs up far above average etc Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful AlexProductions 8 12 pubs 12 pints one night The World s End is the story of Garry King Simon Pegg and the old school gang who re tackle the 5280 feet of alcohol on the Golden Mile in their hometown As Garry is reaching 40 this pub crawl is all he basically has to live for I usually personally judge a movie based on if I was bored at all during the run time and with The World s End I was constantly entertained with the British humor and witty comments coming from Simon and the entire cast The only character in the film I didn t like was Rosamund Pike Picture 1 Her role was just minor and I feel that the film would ve been better without it I walked into the film just for some laughs and a humor and received much more in the end than expected The movie took some completely unexpected twists and turns that neither me nor the rest of the audience were expecting I think that The World s End is the summer blockbuster film I never got When I think back on this year s break I never really could remember a movie I actually left the theater satisfied with Pegg s acting was the best I have ever seen from him and I think that this single August release promotes his ability and range of all the parts he can play WELL The Sci Fi aspect of the film weaved together nicely with the mix of comedy in an un awkward way When the sci fi aspect did come about I did feel the film began to become more unrealistic I didn t like how these regular drunks were able to change into mini Jackie Chan s all of a sudden Through the many fight scenes there was really never a time where any one of the characters was in a close to life or death situation I think that even though I thought this was a problem The World s End is a movie that you go into knowing everything won t make perfect sense when you re leaving the theater Being the third film in the series of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz I feel that The World s End felt more like a sequel to Paul than the others it was billed against Overall The World s End is a movie you will feel like you got your money s worth out of in the long run It s one of those films that seems like it would be more fun to watch when you ve had a few pints yourself but either way it is an easy film to enjoy Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful BrandonBonasera 8 Definitely the most heartfelt and creative film in the trilogy but sadly not as good as Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz The World s End is a fitting conclusion that though suffering from some plot holes is plenty of fun and great entertainment though a little slow at times Expand 2 of 3 users found this helpful TVJerry 7 Simon Pegg heads the group of 5 boyhood chums who returns to their hometown 20 years later to complete a legendary 12 pub crawl On their route they discover that the town has changed in an ill fated sci fi way This team of accomplished British actors creates an assured comic ensemble led by Pegg s manic character There aren t a lot of laff out loud moments but there s plenty of good natured energetic fun Add some entirely convincing special effects and clever physical action and you ve got an entertaining romp thru a possessed English village

Critic Reviews User Reviews Write a Review Score distribution Positive 1 out of 1 Mixed 0 out of 1 Negative 0 out of 1 theseparator 8 The total lack of films that come out of Saudi Arabia made Wadjda a Saudi film by Haiffa Al Mansour instantly alluring Haiffa Al Mansour is already credited as being the first successful woman filmmaker in Saudi Arabia s history The precocious 10 year Wadjda is growing up in Riyadh where she wants nothing more than a shiny new bicycle but not only is she a little short on riyals in Saudi Arabia women do not to ride bicycles Saudi moral code bans woman from driving going out in public unveiled living unaccompanied leaving the country alone and opposing their husband s orders in any way This is very much Al Mansour s film She charms the viewer with the common everyday struggles of the Saudi woman and rather than address the issues in a combative way her approach is warm even cute This draws us in to her characters and provides us with some heartfelt laughs along the way Small details make grand impressions In an all girls school teenage students paint their toenails a sin and are publicly vilified for it The mere possibly that workmen half a mile away might see school girls playing in their courtyard forces all the girls to rush inside lest they be judged impure Pubescent girls are considered impure and must use a tissue just flip the pages of Koran Wadjad s truly beautiful mother spends much of her time perfecting her appearance only then to have to then cover herself with a full hijab She is never openly defiant defiance is impossible but even thought she is obeying age old traditions that we d assume would have dulled any emotional protest through the mother s submission we get a brief glimpse of her distress the natural human emotional distress that no amount of aged tradition or religious subjugation has the right to inflict on any human being In a country where cinemas are banned Riyadh is not exactly a city where women can just go around shooting films Females mixing with male co workers would bring dire consequences Al Mansour shot the film anyway directing much of it from the back of a van and the result is a film representing the triumph of the defiant feminine spirit in all forms Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful var nr domain www metacritic com var nrelate dwparams mapp nrelate comptype widget comp 380

were raunchy a lot of f bombs crude jokes and hand gestures but lighten up it s a comedy and I did not really guess the twist at the end In all a fun feel good movie Puritans be warned I rate this a

Millers has top notch acting hilarious jokes and everything you need in a comedy A must see Expand 0 of 2 users found this helpful tropicAces 8 It is by no conceivable measure original or perfect but Millers is honestly a hilarious movie Sudeikis proves he will have a great post SNL career and there are some one liners here that are just great It does try a little too hard to up the ante by adding guns because Identity Thief and Hangover 3 proved that always makes things hilarious right That was rhetorical by the way But it never tries to be anything it s not It s just an entertaining and very funny film I usually agree with critics but in this case screw em Expand 3 of 4 users found this helpful Thegodfatherson 7 We re the Millers is exactly what moviegoers should expect based on the pairing of drugs and family in the initial premise Anyone that isn t t onboard with either aspect hoping for an over the top stoner comedy or a thoughtful dramedy that explores the challenges of parenthood and adolescence may find Thurber s film doesn t quite satisfy either extreme Still a strong cast manages to elevate any stale character archetypes and familiar story lines for an enjoyable albeit not groundbreaking misadventure It s not the funniest or most thoughtful comedy but We re the Millers strikes a fresh middle ground that should provide viewers with a number of memorable scenes both humorous and oddly sweet Expand 0 of 2 users found this helpful BrianMcCritic 6 This film has its moments but the clich d finally works against the film only allowing for a mild recommendation The film is still worth itt for some real strong laughs almost a 7 but it just falls short B Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful man 5 The trailers made this one look kind of funny but unfortunately this really wasn t that good It was pretty dumb for the most part and just came off as goofy and obnoxious for a majority of the film The humor felt too obvious and painfully forced Other than the whole fake family plot the rest felt very cliche and unoriginal as it failed to bring any original laughs or humor to the table Everyone except for Jason Sudeikis was a complete waste Jason was able to keep the slight amount of entertainment I had with this film with his frequently clever and funny one liners Jennifer Aniston who I ABSOLUTELY HATE AND CANNOT STAND was annoying and sucked as usual and yes her sexy stripper body could not make up for it Will Poulter was kinda funny in a couple parts but mostly just came off as your typical and average dorky ginger Emma Roberts wasn t funny at all She was just a stupid annoying and unlikeable foul mouthed punk the entire time Also pretty much after the one hour mark the rest of the film just got lazy and began to drag horribly for the remaining run time Overall I was really let down by this film because I actually thought it looked somewhat hilarious from the trailers But this was not the case at all All I can really suggest is that you skip it and maybe just wait for Redbox if you must Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Qgal5kap 0 I think I enjoyed the first couple minutes of this movie After that it

too well The movie has a potential to be a brilliant one it is shot very well acting is superb all details are done to the best of French cinematography Unfortunately the twist near the end turns this drama into a some kind of a thriller In my opinion not believable not necessary and not tasteful If not for the ending I would give this movie a 9 Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful var nr domain

It s a breath of fresh air among all the terrible slasher movies out there nowadays It doesn t quite revolutionize the slasher genre but it is definitely a strong comeback Shari Vinson was magnificent as Erin She is definitely one of the greatest horror movie leading ladies of all time She was smart fierce and an all around bad ass The other characters are pretty shallow spoiled and two dimensional but when you see this movie you ll understand how it s makes up for this little flaw While the movie contained some jump scares overall it wasn t scary but that s pretty much standard for a slasher film But what it lacks in scares it makes up tenfold in the gore department This film is a roller coaster of carnage and it does so with finesse and panache and features one of the greatest horror movie deaths of all time This film was getting major hype way before it premiered and by God it delivers with intensity and ferocity that needs to be experienced way more than once Expand 1 of 2 users found this helpful LamontRaymond 9 No the acting isn t incredible but the movie is just FUN for a change The Aussie lead is awesome and there s a light hearted feel to this film amidst the carnage that makes you feel good as you leave the theater It s not ponderous Expand 2 of 4 users found this helpful BrandonBonasera 8 Being one of the most fun movies to come out this year You re Next is a violent and incredibly entertaining horror comedy that is both quite funny and full with fun twists The film is definitely flawed in which it has a rocky start before it descends into greatness and having not very fantastic acting apart from Sharni Vinson who plays to badass lead role and I would have liked the have some closure in the ending though the end was still pretty fun In the end You re Next is a gory good time in theatres Expand 2 of 2 users found this helpful Compi24 7 As far as horror movies are concerned You re Next doesn t really bring too much innovative material to the table

there s enough innovation and enthusiasm for the horror genre present in You re Next to make it worth recommending to gore hounds and and hardcore horror lovers even though the movie doesn t succeed at hitting all the big marks it aims for Just don t expect to leave the theater feeling all that unnerved or extra conscious about needing to lock your doors once you get home Expand 0 of 0 users

catalog will say More of the same good songs but not compelling I have listened to Dr Dog for years seen them live five times and KNOW that they are great American songwriters This album takes the familiarity and gives it a new life the production and subject matter is the most diverse of any of their albums resulting in what I would say is my new favorite Dr Dog album I hate when a band feels stagnant like time hasn t passed Beach House a prime example Albums run together songs lose their meaning Dr Dog has delivered an album that takes up its own place in the void of nameless indie pop groups that all rely on new midi and drum machines sounds to differentiate themselves from the other voice identical to theirs Dr Dog finds a new voice with each album the progress is essential I always think of what the next album should look like and I would love a total departure from past efforts for any band Dr Dog seems to take the next step naturally reflecting the motions in life that

rock bands they produce pop song after after pop song Cornell not only knows what rock is all about he explores different genres which makes the album all the more interesting Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful ArthurDent 5 Very dissapoing album Top marks for him not just trying to rehash the Soundgarden Audioslave sound but that doesen t mean much when the songs don t really amount to much There are a few highlights You Know My Name Safe and Sound Killing Birds and the album is certinally listenable But it pales in comparison to his other solo masterpiece Euphoria Morning and is unforunately a bit of a waste of talent Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful jamesonc 2 chris cornell what the hell did you think you were doing when you wrote this crap 0 of 0 users found this helpful GabeM 0 This album is horrible If you want to listen to a proper Chris Cornell album check out Euphoria Morning Cornell sounds lost and without directoin on Carry On resulting in meandering

instant fan Expand 4 of 4 users found this helpful kyle aaronson 7 I find myself simultaneously wanting to love and hate this band Granted I ve only listened to the album three times so far and while it absolutely is catchy I wish they would venture more into the sounds that they produce for the album s eighth track My Song 5 Of course tracks such as Falling If I Could Change Your Mind and Honey I are all unbelievably catchy but most songs sound pretty similar I was glad to find though that most of the tracks are stronger than The Wire which was one of the few I listened to before listening to the whole album I believe it d be difficult for anyone to actually dislike this album Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Slowave 6 A few good songs and then a few too many is this a different song songs The sound mood and approach wears a bit thin after the first couple of standouts and I wish they d mixed things up a bit While they seem fresh and fun now I can see them saturating popular

an album than Justified was Songs which sound puzzlingly self indulgent in isolation most obviously the smirking tenuously tuneful first single SexyBack are cloaked in a compelling intensity and

TheGorilla 10 This album is a breath of fresh air I listened to it in 2006 and it was amazing Six years later a started listening to it again and it still feels the same way It never gets old His best

because I actually hate Justin Timberlake s personality and find him to be immature That being said this album surprised me The production is absolutely excellent although Timbaland overproduces artist Justin benefits from this because its less creative input from him and more from the producer This is the best Justin Timberlake album and it is probably the best he ll ever do AMG underrated this album and it is only slightly less impressive than the excellent Nelly Furtado collaboration with Timbaland Timberlake gets points off for the pointless interludes that demonstrate he is just trying to hard At first listen the album absolutely shimmers with ear candy With repeated listenings the production still stands up on its own merits and Justin gives an inspiring performance Expand 0

for electronic music so far with many of the greats returned and delivering some of their best works in a long time So far this year we had Ulrich Schnauss return with his first album under his own name in five years delivering another dreamy ambient album A Long Way to Fall Tricky releasing a new album similar to the sound with his debut Maxinquaye with False Idols Karl Hyde from Underworld releasing his stellar debut solo album Edgeland Daft Punk saving dance music from the recycled corporate hands of will i am while also giving it a new edge with the excellent Random Access Memories Boards of Canada releasing their first album in eight years with the brilliant Tomorrow s Harvest BT returning to his pure old skool roots in the trance genre while also updating marvellously in A Song Across Wires and coming up we have VNV Nation releasing their new album titled Transnational Now we have Moby who just released his eleventh studio album this week Innocents recreates a lot of the material that has worked to his advantage over a decade ago with Play while also throwing the best elements from his last couple of albums mainly Wait for Me and Destroyed resulting in an album that is rich pure soothing hugely sentimental and beautifully uplifting However this time he s not doing the album on his own For the very first time he s worked with an outside producer named Mark Spike Stent a grammy award winning producer who s worked with just about everyone in pop including Madonna U2 Coldplay Oasis Muse Ellie Goulding Pink Keane and Lady Gaga just to name a few He even worked with one of the electronic greats like Bj rk and Massive Attack He also invited many guests vocalists on the record as well including Cold Specks singing superbly on A Case for Shame and Tell Me Damien Jurado delivering dreamy vocals on Almost Home Wayne Coyne from The Flaming Lips sings with Moby on the gospel chanting uplifting The Perfect Life Skylar Grey gives a wonderful performance on The Last Day Inyang Bassey singing brilliantly on the catchy Don t Love Me and Mark Lanegen Screaming Trees Queens of the Stone Age giving a haunting and rich raspy vocal on the emotionally driven The Lonely Night Even with having all these guest vocalists and another producer on board it doesn t distract that it s still a Moby album and he manages to steal the show giving a nice performance on the album closer The Dogs and also delivering an excellent EP if you buy the deluxe version titled Everyone Is Gone a thirty minute EP that once again shows off his great skills in making ambient music that is just as good as the main album He stills throws in his usual shtick on some of the tracks but here it is used with great effect Everything that Rises serves as a brilliant opener that showcases what he has in store for the rest of the album Going Wrong is a nice soothing piano driven listen A Long Time is another great vocal sampled song and The Saints sounds a lot like Massive Attack s Unfinished Sympathy which is not a bad thing With superb collaborators and a great producer and with Moby always at the centre of everything and obviously the main attraction Innocents is the most creative compelling and engaging album that Moby has put out since Play and one of the best albums I ve had the pleasure of listening to this year It s up there with Karl Hyde s Edgeland Boards of Canada s Tomorrow s Harvest and Daft Punk s Random Access Memories as one of the best electronic albums of 2013 Track Picks Innocents Main Album 1 Everything that Rises 2 A Case for Shame with Cold

users found this helpful Frikomid 9 I think it s like Destroyed II but that is awesome The album sounds like Destroyed and a bit like Wait for Me it s like if he s creating a Long Triple Album but it s a huge album full of sounds that can make you dream awake Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful jmartrican 9 I am very much enjoying listening to this album Its really laid back and filled with a diverse range of vocals This is exactly what I wanted These are some real soulful tracks Excellent While I have heard a few Moby songs here and there and I really like them I have never really sat down and listened to any of his previous albums After listening to this album i ll definitely check out his previous stuff Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful var nr domain www metacritic com var

Knights of the Soundtable ride again King Animal is Soundgarden s first studio album since their 2010 reunion and their first album of new material since 1996 s Down on the Upside And this album was definitely worth the wait Soundgarden driven by the wailing and no less powerful vocals of Chris Cornell the mighty guitar riffs of Kim Thayil the bouncy basslines of Ben Shepherd and the eclectic and versatile drumming of Matt Cameron have crafted a magnificent work of rock n roll The overall vibe is similar to that of the band s previous albums Superunknown IMO their magnum opus and Down on the Upside The songs are grungy without sounding nostalgic instead they sound like a fresh reawakening The band maneuvers through odd time signatures with ease performing with vitality despite their older age There are fast songs and slow songs heavy rockers and soft acoustic tracks psychedelic dirges and energetic bursts of alt metal Hats off to Soundgarden for making not only an excellent comeback album but one of the best albums of 2012 Expand 4 of 4 users found this helpful Rockman1976 9 No this album is not a 10 But it s hands down better than anything Cornell and the rest of the guys put out during the band shut down It sounds more Superunknown than Down On The Upside which is good To me best album of 2012 along with Killing Joke The Walkmen and dEUS Expand 0 of 1 users found this

It s not terrible but it s not great either Every song feels like mediocrity after mediocrity Perhaps it is Cornell s voice that is holding it back Since Audioslave his works have been in decline I

good but I don t like every song Team is notably the best I give Lorde credit for bringing out such a unique sound even if to somewhat mixed results Look forward to new stuff Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful hobart barista 7 There is a general backdrop of claps basic synths and vocal backups that make the album quite predictable It almost feels they ve just put different lyrics onto the same song There is an odd sense of wisedom in the lyrics despite the young timbre of the vocals However the incessant self referencing is somewhat unbearable The music is generally minamilistic Tennis court is a stand out Following that is 400 Lux That slightly husky voice breaking from singing to speech and soft percussion and touches of electronica Royals has more dynamicism in the vocals but still that non chalant percussion The lyrics are fine She s cracked the code to life and she s not like other musos who constantly talk about diamonds and vodka However one would question that she talks about having no money Sure bruh sure Don t look into it but it might come off as a little hypocritical It s definitely a song the audience can identifiy with though Ribs has a beat to it defo more electro With mainstream lyrics it doesn t immediately stand out but it s definitely on the stronger side musically a break from the first three songs which have a similiar formula The bridge in this dance song is particularly great Buzzcut season has an army war theme to it Again the matter of friendship comes to hand Her and her friend live in a ethereal journey where everything is good Reality is the one who wins so join it say the men But they have other things on their mind It has a generic yet cool little beat to it The vocals swell with the imagery Team starts out with a good vocal intro a bit of lyrical repitition and even vocal effects yay Then those claps come in again She sings about growing up in a different world and the unity of the people who have done this Did they Control C V those synths The verse and chorus are not too much different from eachother inbetween is this little bit Dancin around the lies we tell Dancin around big eyes as well oh Even the comatose they don t dance and tell There are fightin words in Glory and gore four hundred and thirteen of them I m beginning to feel as if their should be a label Warning References of self references This one talks about how they re gladiators and the audience lusts after blood between famous people but the only reason they re famous is because they are in the ring and they secretly love it This is where my anger kicks in From a lyrical stand point this gets no rapport I can t identify with this not many can To do this constantly is very annoying and not one of the hallmarks of any great writers or many good ones even To those who consider it a lyrical masterpiece please consider Still sane starts out with some soft bass and finally a few hits on the ride Uncreative keyboard eigth notes come in later However the penultimate verse has some of the nicer percussion of the album You can guess what the songs about based on the title They re still sane even after becoming famous Cool man In general the lyrics are bit less image focused more vague White teeth teens This is a stand out It s nice to have a change of pace It could be about dating or it could be about the cool group at school and I m more inclined to think the latter It s a smidge faster and the drums come in not long after you press play and it just seems different This along with the last track provide a different sound for the end of the album I particularly like the outro check it There are some XX rhythmic vibes in the bass and kick A world alone Slightly melancholy guitar starts Then singing Then it comes to life The lyrics speak of a friendship amongst people who just talk There is a starkness to the lyrics but also love A fav Good A few good hooks really make this album mostly in Royals and Tennis court The vocals are quite well done and nothing seems out of place within any of the songs Bad Their sound gets very predictable I m looking at you Synths Vocals and Percussion Also there is fistfulls of melodrama that smack you in the face I also hear Lana is abusive Themes friendship anti money you re place in the world Favs Ribs although lyrics a little ho hum and a word alone Buzzcut season also a five star rating Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Kiva 5 The sound is good the music and the voice too But Pure Heroine I love the title has only a few songs that are quite interesting In the songs the lyrics are poor and that s something that disappointed me a lot However I want to support Lorde as she is a young artist which has a bright future and I hope she doesn t turn up like Miley Cyrus Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful See all 9 User Reviews var nr domain www metacritic com var nrelate dwparams mapp nrelate comptype widget comp 380 riaevent view s6

fantastic Timberlake s signing is on point the writing is amazing the sulky production is also fantastic This is what pop and R B is supposed to be Should be hailed as the classic it is in a few years Expand 7 of 9 users found this helpful DrewBrauer 10 Man it s been a while since we ve heard from Justin Timberlake or JT for short in the music world After debuting his new single Suit Tie with Jay Z everyone was curious to see what Timberlake was going to do next and with the announcement of two albums in one year 20 20 Experience 2 of 2 comes out later this fall we all wanted to see how Timberlake could do it Ladies and Gentlemen JT did it The 20 20 Experience may possibly be one of the best albums I ve heard in quite sometime Exceptionally written Expertly produced and well excellent The one thing that could keep this from being the best album of the year could be Timberlake s second release this year we ll have to see 20 20 Experience is unconventional to all Pop music out there it s different and at times it s just R B it s Brilliant Justin Timberlake is at the top of his game here his vocals here are Natural Toned in Well and flows smoothly with everything going on The album is only about ten songs long but it s also a little more than 70 minutes long I was consistently into the music all the way until the final seconds of the last song Blue Ocean Floor speaking of songs there are many standout s here which include Suit Tie Let the Groove Get in Pusher Love Girl and Tunnel Vision all sound amazing Hardly any problems here but listeners looking for mainstream Pop should stay away from this it s very different and if you want something different then this is a must One of the Best albums of 2013 The 20 20 Experience is a wonderful experience and something that will go down as one of Timberlake s best and most iconic releases ever Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful GunnSlinger 9 For all the JT fans that associate him to his Cry Me A River days this record is going to be a little too hard to soak in for a while After that it s going to be the best thing they ve ever heard It s a record that needs time to grow on you Once you listen to it a few times you ll automatically find the music a breath of fresh air We re surrounded by the music by the likes of Rihanna Drake Jay Z Usher etc The music of theirs is almost the same with a few exceptions This album is different just like FutureSex LoveSounds was when it released in 2006 This is a great album and with time it ll grow on you A masterpiece it is for me Kudos to JT and Timbaland and I can t wait for the 2nd Volume to the album coming out in November this year Cheers Expand 3 of 4 users found this helpful ClayMerritt 8 The ultimate love album While the length of the album may seem a problem to some Justin Timberlake does a fine job at making fine music While better than his debut album he falls just short of doing better than his last outing FutureSex LoveSound He starts the album out amazingly with Pusher Love Girl which by the way should have been the albums first single instead of Suit Tie Then you get to Suit Tie which by now is incredibly overplayed but a still relatively good song then you finish Track 5 Tunnel Vision which isn t that good then you get to Spaceship Coupe which isn t that good either but you start That Girl and Let The Groove In and all s forgiven Then you hit the second single off this album Mirrors and finish off with Blue Ocean Floor Aside from the two aforementioned tracks that weren t that good this album is amazing Relieving to hear from Justin Timberlake again He s better suited making music rather than starring in sub par movies I can t wait for Volume 2 of The 20 20 Experience when it comes out this Fall Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful JTayHall 8 After all these year JT has come back and dominated the airwaves making sure to produce songs that get played over the radios ever 36 minutes on average and might i say great job for giving us a great album nothing is as it seems in this voyage to the human heart but what should we expect Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful thugnificent2 7 the beats are the main thing on this album justin timberlake only shines on a few songs suit and tie is probably the best song on the album the songs are also too long he needs to cut songs in half instead of just changing the beat Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful JamieM 0 Dear Justin I think you already released this album back in 2006 except that the songs were 4 min shorter and didn t drag The 20 20 is nothing but an unbearable DRAG and defo not a sexy back Quite unsexy actually Thank God for Spotify didn t have to waste money on this Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful See all

absolutely perfect and the instrumentation supports it to a tee My only real problem with the album is that they play it safe for certain but I can let that go due to the fact that it s their first album and I m sure there is experimentation left to come Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Polaxk 10 This is really one of the most accessible albums I ve heard this year You really can t fault well crafted pop albums for sticking to the genre I find it a complete buzzkill to speculate on the possible future when they ve released one album Every song on this is a pretty perfectly crafted pop song in the best sense Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful kyle aaronson 9 About the most fun an album can be one of the critics on the right said that even the most jaded people would enjoy it and I completely agree with that statement It was preceded by a few really good singles as well so the band obviously had potential and it s good to see that can put together an entire album of solid songs That being said this music will get old unless they start to get somewhat experimental on their next few albums and ideally they won t submit to pop and digress into simple brain numbing synths Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful WadeVS 7 Crystal clear vocals flawless production and a sound which is both familiar and fresh this is a band who puts their best foot forward Take no chances Lauren sings on Tether and to some degree they take their own advice This might not have been the adventurous debut many had anticipated but they do what they do best which is upbeat likeable electronic pop This is a strong showing but I fear in coming years it will not be too memorable Expand 3 of 3 users found this helpful adhamhany 7 The entire album seems to be influenced by the sound of 80s pop which is a great thing I just wished that the rest of the tracks are as fantastic as Gun undeniably the best one on the album and one of the best that i listened to in quite some time Really breathtaking Also The Mother We Share We Sink and By The Throat are great tracks Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful Nedloh94 6 This is shiny it s fun and it s an okay album Yet there are a myriad of flaws The songwriting though often interesting is lacking Chvrches seems to be focusing on the sound but the mood never varies much and there is quite a bit of sameness The lyrics here are passable but suffer from being juvenile and overly simplistic There are some gorgeous arrangements and the production here is very lush and tactful A lot of these songs would work very well on their own but this as an album is a little less than the sum of the parts A solid debut but far from perfect Expand 0 of 1 users found this helpful var nr domain www metacritic com var nrelate dwparams mapp

happen because it is commercialized I loved his first 3 albums and the fourth was okay but this does not even come close to his first three albums I love Dizzee but this is bad Expand 0 of 0 users

vocal performances remain ever present Some real surprises come in the non typical Iain Archer singing style on the intro to The Beginning Of The End and the stunning vocal contributions from Minnie Driver Your Way Is The Way Home Yes it sounds a little like a Snow Patrol album in places but that s no bad thing and the steady hands of Peter Buck Scott McCaughey et all make it an effortless sounding affair Expand 0 of 0 users found this helpful devitamariana 10 I think it s an album so beautiful and striking as The Joshua Tree Beautiful vocals Sounding flawless Sounds like Snow Patrol due to the remarkable personality of Gary Lightbody Expand 0 of 3 users found this helpful ReginaReis 10 This album is EPIC for me Since The place we ran from I knew that next one will be amazing Gary Lightbody is an amazing singer and songwriter and his voice is better than ever I hope the next Snow Patrol s album will be like The ghost of the mountain Expand 0 of 3 users found this helpful WadeVS 6 For a supergroup involving this many individuals from this many bands Lightbody s presence is the most felt Not such a bad thing but you have to use your imagination to differentiate this from a Snow Patrol effort The bits of country and Americana are so timid and restrained you wonder why they bothered but overall this is a very fresh pretty album Probably has a lot of replay value Expand 2

of frightening the way he changed Heisenberg is the king now It s going to be a wild ride Expand 51 of 56 users found this helpful Nedical 10 Having been turned on the the show earlier this summer I quickly breezed through seasons 1 4 and caught up to 5 just in time to watch the premiere All I can say is WOW Each season gets better and better with the current being the swan song The train episode was fantastic and kept me on the end of my seat while the rest are almost as enjoyable I have never stumbled upon a series with as much dramatic and suspenseful depth and Breaking Bad is Vince Gilligan s ace in the hole Expand 2 of 2 users found this helpful Smartine7 10 The narrative of this show is so finely crafted that completely unpredictable twists appear to fit seamlessly with the grand story arc The characters are portrayed so well that you don t even have to like them to appreciate all of the nuance and suspense is at an all time high The fifth episode Dead Freight ends in such a way that even hard boiled fans will find it appalling and brilliant Cranston Gilligan and the Breaking Bad crew have done the impossible with these first eight episodes they ve made Americans fall in love with an amoral meth dealer But I think I speak for us all when I say that we wouldn t want it any other way Expand 3 of 3 users found this helpful tejas02 10 The part two of the final season is very very engaging Because its reaping time for the character of wlater white for all the things that he has done The character has grown from a common man to a unimaginable persona that surprises you each time he is on screen You are here for a treat because it s gonna end big and when it does be there to witness THE END Expand 4 of 4 users found this helpful slothrop 4 With season 5 Breaking Bad is still in the top 30 shows on TV the problem is that the previous four seasons put it in the top 5 Breaking Bad s strength has always been its balance between plot and character development alongside mostly excellent acting Season 5 tilts this balance far too much towards plot development And the plot through five episodes of this season comes up short Far too often it appears forced featuring too many unrealistic coincidences and predictable twists As such the actors don t have the opportunity to shine as in the previous four seasons instead appearing stagnated in a predictable slightly above average drama Expand 21 of 181 users found this helpful See all 203 User Reviews Related Articles TV Episode Review Breaking Bad Series Finale Published September 29 2013

real Carrie just kills it as always We couldn t see Brody in episode 1 but I reckon he will stay as a mystery and reveal himself slowly I love how the producers use the characters I want to mention that there are lots of references to CIA If you liked season 2 you re gonna like this too If you don t Homeland is still the best you can find on TV Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful danielhalak 10 This show just keeps getting better Season 3 doesn t disappoint at all Dramatic surprising and amazing actors and actresses It s even better than season 1 and season 2 Expand 4 of 5 users found this helpful MikaelZ 10 Even thought there wasn t as much action or intensity in this episode it was a very strong season opener with wonderful performances and moving scenes which allows the season to grow Also when Damian Lewis character Brody returns the season will just get better Expand 1 of 1 users found this helpful MyName 10 This review contains spoilers click expand to view Homeland is back Following the events of the season 2 finale the show feels different but it is still great Claire Danes will win another Emmy and Golden Globe award for her performance in this season I am interested to see how the Brody storyline will play out once he is back Expand 2 of 3 users found this helpful thanasismsrls 10 Not enough TV shows are almost perfect in their entire first two seasons One of this few series is Homeland This new season keeps up the tension and encourages us to discover new aspects of Carrie Saul and Dana Expand 3 of 4 users found this helpful VF139 4 Homeland could have taken the Breaking Bad route or the Dexter route Seems like they have chosen the latter and the first episode is a disappointing confirmation of this The quality the show had in its pilot season is sadly lost It insults the intelligence of the average viewer stretching credulity and trying patience Hopefully this first episode is a minor distraction and things will improve in the coming weeks Expand 1 of 2 users found this helpful bhartman36 2 I watched the season opener for Homeland last night If anything it s gotten less engaging as time has gone on I dropped out of watching it last season because Carrie Mathison was a completely unsympathetic and unbelievable character to have that position in the CIA It hasn t gotten any better You know a show is bad when you root for the protagonist to get machine gunned Expand 1 of 4 users found this helpful See all 8 User Reviews Related Articles TV Episode Reviews Homeland Season 2 Finale Published December 17 2012 Did last night s
