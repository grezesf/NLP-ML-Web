Especially with open access publication, the fees tend to come out at a substantial amount.
In general, the corresponding author seems to be responsible to the journal for the payment of the fee. I wonder what would be commonly acceptable agreements with coauthors to split such fees?
There is already a general question on splitting collaboration costs here, but the current answer does not apply to publication fees, and I am really interested in this specific case. I think your question is a little backwards: All ways of splitting the publication fees are acceptable. You might run into some problems with your grant officer about transferring money around, but in the end they will get over it.
The more important question in my opinion is: What behaviour is acceptable from you and your co-authors. I believe the answer is to be nice since these are your co-authors after all. I wouldn't be too put off if a co-author refused to contribute to open access fees or if I was asked to contribute 1/N of the fees for an N author paper where I was a tertiary author and currently under-funded.','Splitting publication fees among coauthors',2,link
'http___academia_stackexchange_com_questions_1118.html',14,'phd application','How do I deal with diverse interests when applying for a PhD program? I have a master's degree in Computer Science. I have applied to PhD programs, and decisions are trickling in. I may soon have to choose between two or more PhD programs.
Unfortunately, I have diverse interests. I was advised that a successful PhD application is usually quite specific, so I made each of my applications very specific. I wrote to a professor working in decision making (AI), another working in computational learning theory, another working in computer music, another working in quantum & parallel computing, another working in logical foundations & philosophy of computation. With much enthusiasm, I informed each professor that I was interested in pursuing a PhD in his / her field. This is true. I am interested in each of these fields, and know something about each of them. When advised to apply, I did.
The problem is - being interested in each of these fields also means that I'm interested in all of them. (There are more areas of CS I'm interested in. What's worse - my interests are not even restricted to CS. For the purposes of this post, I'm restricting myself to only the mentioned areas.) So when I choose between PhD programs, I'm choosing between completely different areas - and that is surely going to be excruciating.
This is not a case of not knowing my 'true interest' now, only to discover it later. I have no 'true interest'. I have always pursued numerous unrelated things in parallel. I love all my interests equally. In fact, I love the feeling of 'being interested' more than the interests themselves. Whenever I've tried to restrict myself to one topic of study - even for a month - that feeling is lost, and I am quickly bored. As a result, my skill-set is a classic case of a jack of all trades - master of none. The worst part is - everybody knows that a PhD is about getting deep into one specific topic. It's not about breadth - it's about depth. Even if I were to choose one of the PhD programs (and I must choose one), I have a feeling that I might get bored quickly and be prone to constant topic-changing / transferring. Again, this is not about being fickle - it's about following my heart, and my heart takes me to different things at different times.
Do you think I'm likely to fail / never complete my PhD? Does anyone have any advice about dealing with diverse interests? Has anyone felt the same way and dealt with it? I'd love to hear from you. (My experience with non-American PhD programs is limited, so some of what I say here may not be relevant or possible.)
First, I think you may have painted yourself into a corner.  More important than being specific, PhD applications should be honest.  Hopefully your applications described the breadth of your interests, perhaps with some extra emphasis and detail in one area, rather than implying falsely that you are only interested in one topic.  It's better to be rejected than to be accepted into a PhD program where you won't thrive.
I think you need to look for overlaps and connections between your various fields of interest.  Decision theory and machine learning are not that far apart.  Quantum computing and philosophy of computing are not that far apart.  Parallel computing and logic are not that far apart.  Decision theory and logic are not that far apart.  Machine learning and computer music are not that far apart.  Finding something at the intersection of five or six different areas is almost certainly impossible, but lots of interesting stuff happens at the interface between field X and field Y.
On the other hand, all the areas you describe are incredibly diverse within their own boundaries.  You may find enough different topics within (say) machine learning to keep your fickle heart satisfied.
One thing you should ask about (quickly!) is the possibility of having multiple (ie, two) advisors in different areas.  Some departments encourage inter-disciplinary co-advising; some don't.  Some advisors encourage collaboration with other faculty; others flatly forbid it.  (In many European PhD programs, students are attached to specific projects of specific faculty from day one, and moving between projects or fields is almost impossible.)
What worries me more than the diversity of your interests is this sentence: "Whenever I've tried to restrict myself to one topic of study - even for a month - that feeling is lost, and I am quickly bored".  You have to get over that.  Research requires long-term focused attention.  Early in your PhD program, you may be able to juggle a couple of different research projects at once, but eventually, you have to focus on a coherent thesis topic.  It can be an interdisciplinary topic, sure, but it has be coherent.  You will have to work on that one topic for years.  If that sounds awful to you, then maybe you don't want to be a PhD student after all.
My department head has changed fields several times in his career, so I think his advice on this topic is worth repeating.  Assuming good health and good luck, you have a 50-year research career ahead of you.  So if you're deeply interested in half a dozen different areas, you can afford to spend seven or eight years on each one. I'd start with a fundamental question: why do you want to get a Ph.D.?  It's a major commitment of time and effort, so it's only worthwhile if you need a Ph.D. to accomplish your long-term goals.  Getting a Ph.D. really isn't worth doing for its own sake, or out of a feeling that it's something you ought to do (because you like computer science, or enjoy education, or feel you should have the highest degree you can get).  Really, it's just preparation for what you'll do after you graduate.
So from this perspective, the question becomes what you hope to be doing in ten or fifteen years.  Not specific topics, but rather what sort of career.  When you look around at faculty or industrial researchers, do you see people who make you say "Yes, that's exactly the sort of work and the range of topics I'd love"?  If you do, then you should look into these cases specifically.  You can study websites and CVs, and maybe even e-mail a few questions (although keep in mind that people will be busy, so don't be pushy and don't waste time with questions you can answer in other ways).  How did they end up in these positions that appeal to you?
If you can find many people doing what you'd like to do, then that's an excellent sign, and you just have to learn how they did it.  If you can find only a few, or even none, then you should worry that maybe a Ph.D. isn't the right path for you.  In that case, if you enter a Ph.D. program you've got to hope for one of two things.  Either academia will change you, or you will change academia.  Either is possible, but neither is likely.
I don't mean for this to be discouraging, but I strongly recommend thinking this through carefully before getting too far into a Ph.D. program (if you haven't already).  Once you start, quitting is difficult psychologically even when it's clearly the right decision.  It's easy to spend years in denial, knowing things aren't really working out the way you had anticipated but hoping they'll somehow get better.  This isn't healthy, so the more thinking you do in advance, the better.
Good luck!  I hope you either find role models in this career path or find another that suits you better. It is possible that you will have trouble finishing your dissertation and thus obtaining your PhD.
It is easy to do your coursework; each subject takes only one semester.  You'll finish your subjects before you get bored.  But a dissertation usually takes a year or more to finish.
One possibility is to take your PhD at a university which allows publication of a few papers as equivalent to a dissertation.  You can make the papers about different fields and yet related to each other.','How do I deal with diverse interests when applying for a PhD program?',4,None
'http___academia_stackexchange_com_questions_11590.html',14,'citations ethics','Should bad prior work be ignored, or cited and criticised? A high citation rate is desirable in academia.  Citing other work doesn't cost much, so citations are cheap to give but desirable to get.  That brings me to the question:
If a previous article addresses a topic similar to the one I'm writing, is that a sufficient reason to cite it?  Or should the prior article meet a minimum quality to "deserve" a citation?  To put it bluntly: if I'm aware of a prior crappy article, should I ignore it, or cite it and write why it's crap (of course in a more diplomatic way)?
In my field, some articles questioning anthropogenic climate change get quite a lot of citations from colleagues pointing out flaws in their reasoning or statistics...
Note that I'm exclusively talking about peer-reviewed publications. Negative citations is what you describe. It is something of a fallacy of the system that a paper may get many citations and therefore seems important when it is clearly sub-par and is referenced in a negative connotation.
Seen objectively, one should give credit where it is due. If someone was first to realize something then that is the origin of the idea (in official terms), how good or bad the paper is, is irrelevant. In some cases first discoveries may just be gut feelings and not well-founded. 
I sometimes have to bite my lip when I reference some papers because I really do not think they deserve it (because I know the background) but realize there are no two ways about it. You can of course chose not to reference it, as you have the freedom to chose what we cite, but you may end up getting reviews asking you to add it (if it is something key).
In some cases it is possible to provide objective criticism of a paper. The problem is that the shortcomings will have to be clear. There's a certain amount of judgment that needs to be exercised here. One of my more frequently cited publications is an attempt to correct methodological errors in a previous work (which was also highly cited). While it got the point across, it has also led to my work not being cited by the other authors, even though they've adopted the methodological points laid out in my paper.
Now, part of the reason why we discussed the work in detail was because there were major problems that led us to being unable to reproduce their results when we used their techniques with the "advantages" of modern technology. Since it in fact "inspired" our work, we felt the extended discussion was appropriate. However, if the same paper were to present results that were simply wrong, and didn't have the same "primacy" within the research literature, we would have probably ignored it.
Literature citations in standard journal papers (as opposed to review articles) are not meant to be ecumenical or exhaustive. Your job, as an author, is to exercise judgment as to which articles provide an accurate overview of the state of work in the field, and provide the best support for the arguments you wish to make. It depends what is your goal. If you are doing a thorough review of literature, you will have to cite prior work, even if your opinion of it is low (and you can briefly state why). If you are doing a comment, follow-up or other work where criticism of the prior work is key to your argumentation, then of course you have to cite it. But, if the field is otherwise plentiful and there are other more successful prior works which you can cite, you don't need to be exhaustive, and you can thus omit those works which you consider subpar (or of low originality, or derivate works).','Should bad prior work be ignored, or cited and criticised?',4,None
'http___academia_stackexchange_com_questions_2498.html',28,'graduate-school','Is transferring an option for an unhappy grad student? (I hope this is on topic; please delete if not. If the answer varies by subject please mention the subject in your answer.)
I've heard of people transferring between graduate schools because of their advisor moving to another school and taking their students with them. 
Do students ever transfer for other reasons? If a student isn't happy at the school they choose, could transferring be an option? Presumably they would frame it as something positive such as "turns out I really want to work with Professor X" rather than "I hate my school", but does this ever happen? Is there a certain timeframe in which this is possible? (Assume it's a 5 year PhD program.)
(Context: many friends have told me that if it turns out I'm not happy with my choice, I can always transfer. My impression is that this is actually difficult since many schools don't accept transfer students and in any case not being able to stick with a program looks bad -- but I don't have evidence either way so wanted to ask people who are in academia. Of course the ideal would be to pick a school one is happy with in the first place!) Mathematics
Let me specify that by transferring, I mean moving to another university in the middle of a graduate program.  Switching universities between undergrad and grad or between a master's degree and a Ph.D. is very different.  Basically, those are the only mainstream opportunities to move, and anything else will require an exception.
Transferring is certainly not unheard of, but there are some serious caveats:

It's difficult to transfer to a substantially more prestigious department.  It can happen, but the admissions committee will be very skeptical, and it's just not going to work out unless the application is outstanding.  In particular, many committee members specifically do not want to reward rolling the dice again and seeing what happens, so for transfers the question is not "Does this application look better than our weaker students?" but rather "Is this application so obviously wonderful that we would be shooting ourselves in the foot if we accepted someone else instead?"
Expressing any unhappiness will make it much harder to transfer.  You may think you'll be happy at the new school, but they will worry about ending up with an unhappy, unproductive grad student on their hands.  And they are right to worry about that: the best predictor of future happiness is past happiness, and many unhappy people have unrealistic beliefs about what would make them happy.
It's hard to transfer once you start seriously working on a thesis.  If your work isn't going well, then that's a reason not to accept you.  If your work is going well, then that's a reason you should continue working with your current advisor.  Unless your advisor has died or left, it will be tough to convince anyone you are a good candidate for transferring.
No matter why you say you want to transfer, there will be some suspicion that your goal is to end up in a stronger department or a more desirable location.  If you have another reason, you'll have to make a powerful argument for it.


I've heard of people transferring between graduate schools because of their advisor moving to another school and taking their students with them. 

Sometimes they transfer officially, and sometimes they still get degrees from the previous school but complete their theses while in residence at the new school.  The latter is generally easy to arrange when an advisor moves. Computer Science
Yes, PhD students transfer for many reasons besides moving advisors.  Sometimes the reasons are purely professional; for instance, I've seen several students successfully transfer because they  discovered a passion for a subfield that didn't match the interests/experience of the local faculty.  Sometimes they're more personal things like two-body problems (especially when they become three-body problems).  Sometimes advisors die or leave academia.  Sometimes it's because of an irreconcilable disagreement between student and advisor/committee.  Sometimes the student just thinks they can do better than their current department (and has the publications to prove it).
Probably the most painless time to transfer is immediately after completing a master's degree.  (I did this.)  That's a natural time to switch research directions, and many PhD programs allow their students to pick up a Master's degree along the way, even if they don't have a separate Master's program.  (Mine didn't.) 
Still, applications from MS students in PhD departments will face skepticism, especially if the applicant already has a good track record with their former advisor.*  (Why do they want to leave their current advisor?  Shouldn't we offer this slot to someone who doesn't have one?)  So it's important for the applicant's research statement to explain why the new department would a better match, without disparaging the old department.  It's also important to have a strong and supportive recommendation letter from the former advisor, to address possible concerns about technical weaknesses or personality conflicts.
(*And if a PhD applicant doesn't have a good track record with their MS advisor, they're not likely to be admitted anyway.) Computer Science
It's not uncommon for a student to transfer, usually earlier in the program. The reasons can be as you mentioned, and often there are non-academic reasons as well. 
You do have to apply again from scratch, although its possible that admissions committees will look more generously on the application. You might be able to apply out of cycle for spring admission as well - there are fewer applicants and each application gets more careful scrutiny. 
But in any case it is important to have a reason relating to the desired destination. If you want to work with professor X it will help immensely if professor X can speak on your behalf by writing a letter. In other words, don't think of transferring out, but think about transferring in to maybe one or two targeted placed. Field: Mathematics.
Transferring is possible although you might have to 'start over' at your new university. For example, perhaps you have completed the first year sequence of courses in University A and passed some prelims before transferring to University B. At University B you might either be required to go through their first year sequence, or take (and pass) the relevant prelims to have the courses waived. This can be difficult since first year courses and topic and prelims tend to vary across departments. In addition, depending on how much prior experience you have before coming to University B, they might require you to finish your degree in less than usual time (say, 3-4 years instead of 5). In particular, folks with Masters degrees applying to PhD programs are often required to get a second Masters in their second university.

Nevertheless I've continued to work privately on my MSc and PhD thesis' work and lately I've been getting stellar results on the work I did for my MSc thesis. (My thesis work is unrelated to my current employment.) The results have undeniable commercial potential which I hope to explore; yet perhaps because I've spent so much time in academia, I have the urge to publish. I'm keenly aware that publishing has the risk of ceding my competitive advantage to potential competitors, yet I know of a couple of academics who both publish state of the art research in the area of their growing businesses. Therefore I suspect that under some circumstances it is possible to be involved in enterprise and publish, although I'm not sure what those circumstances are.
I'd appreciate your thoughts on this issue. When is it okay to publish when doing enterprise?
Edit: my question is not about whether it is okay to publish if outside academia. Rather, it's about when its okay to publish research that is being seriously considered for a (future) commercial product. The results have undeniable commercial potential

'http___academia_stackexchange_com_questions_5101.html',5,'journals bibliometrics','Does the eigenfactor ranking depend on number of articles in a journal? The eigenfactor is offered by ISI Web of Knowledge as an alternative journal score compared to the impact factor. It is explained on their site as follows:

The Eigenfactor Score calculation is based on the number of times articles from the journal published in the past five years have been cited in the JCR year, but it also considers which journals have contributed these citations so that highly cited journals will influence the network more than lesser cited journals.  References from one article in a journal to another article from the same journal are removed, so that Eigenfactor Scores are not influenced by journal self-citation.

From this explanation, I am not sure whether the eigenfactor depends on the total number of articles that a journal publishes? Wikipedias article on the eigenfactor.org ranking of journals answers your question:

The Eigenfactor score is intended to measure the importance of a journal to the scientific community, by considering the origin of the incoming citations, and is thought to reflect how frequently an average researcher would access content from that journal. However, the Eigenfactor score is influenced by the size of the journal, so that the score doubles when the journal doubles in size (measured as published articles per year).

To give a simple example: the Journal of Physical Chemistry B is the highest-ranked journal in physical chemistry by this criterion in good part because it carries the largest number of articles. It is a good journal, but under all other metrics it is not at the very top of its field.','Does the eigenfactor ranking depend on number of articles in a journal?',2,link link link

It is very beneficial for the host university to have a temporary faculty members free of charge (no salary is normally paid by the host university). (1) How host universities attempt (if they do) to attract visiting professors? Of course, there job advertisements for hiring visiting professors, but I think they are paid positions and different from normal sabbatical leave.
Visiting for research purpose should be arranged with the leader of host research group. Thus, the arrangement is at personal level (somewhat similar to hiring a postdoc researchers.
Visiting for education purpose should be arranged at the level of department chair.
(2) How a professor can find a visiting professor? Is it chancy? to meet a colleague interested to host? Or s/he must contact many professors and department chairs to find a vacancy?
(1) & (2) How should actually initiate this process? guest professor or host university?
(possible 3) Is there a system to facilitate this process, as it is of mutual interest, or everything is left to chancy cases? For example, European Union is much emphasized on mobility of students/professors trough different programmes. Is there such a system for sabbatical visits (in its classical form to completely working at the host university for a period of time, not guest lecturing as it is common in the Europe). I do not have direct experience with sabbaticals, however the professors I've known that have taken them have been explicitly sought out for the respective sabbatical at a particular institution (as a visiting professor), by colleagues that they personally know professionally (i.e., from being in the same field and interacting via conferences, collaborations, etc.).
In other words, it boils down to networking, and almost certainly doesn't come out of nowhere.  If a professor is planning a sabbatical, he or she will probably already have colleagues willing to host, or will start the process by calling up a colleague and pitching the idea.  I would gather that it isn't likely that there are too many successful cold-calls to departments that lead to sabbaticals. Each time I've taken a sabbatical, it has started with an email (or, in years past, a letter). Write to the person (or people) you would like to collaborate with, and let them know you have a sabbatical coming up.

Thank you The current Android Compatibility Definition Document says:

7.3.3.
  GPS Device implementations SHOULD include a GPS receiver. If a device implementation does include a GPS receiver, it SHOULD include some form of "assisted GPS" technique to minimize GPS lock-on time.

So "SHOULD" does not mean "MUST". [Edited because I messed things up. Apps that require GPS show up in the market regardless of whether the device supports it or not.] I am almost positive that all Android phones will have a GPS receiver in them. Cnet reviewed the first Droid in 2009 so chances are they will all have GPS. Considering that E911 requires all cell phones to provide location information to emergency services (Wiki Link), nearly every cell phone contains a GPS receiver for E911 services.  
Given that information, I'd expect there to be very few cell phones (Android or otherwise) that don't have a GPS receiver built-in.  With it already built in, and the OS already having to support it (since the phone system is simply an Android application), it'd be silly to not let other apps take advantage of it (if the user prefers).

If a user has an active WiFi connection, what happens when there's an incoming MMS? It could be done technically. AFAIK all communication between MMS enabled components is done via standard TCP/IP.
But in a regular provider setup the MMS store and forward server(s) (MMSC) are only reachable via the providers network. That's why you can not send and receive MMS via WiFi.
It's also the reason why you can not make a call and send/receive an MMS simultaneously when you have only 2G (GPRS/EDGE) connectivity.
Normally android will drop the GSM data connection if there is WiFi connectivity and all data will be routed through the WiFi interface, but there is one exception: The MMS traffic will still go through the mobile data connection. I dont think it's possible, since the data is sent through the cell network and not through a traditional Wi-Fi style Internet connection. Your network probably uses a separate MMS APN for multimedia messaging, and these are restricted to the operator's own network, so the messages can't be received via WiFi. Also, the messages are directed to your phone number so this could be compared to using SIP/VoIP through your regular phone number.
If there is an active WiFi connection, it is ignored and packet data is used instead (if enabled). This is dependent on the Carrier. UMA is the form of radio that allows the sending of traditional texts and mms over Wifi. T-Mobile in the US is the carrier who has it, as for where you are, I would check with your provider. I think that most (smart) phones do not know how to create a separate IP socket to send/receive MMS over wifi. So they revert by default to the data socket provided by the carrier. Or they may not have the ability to switch between two different sockets automatically. If you do root your phone and change the default MMS IP socket, you may lose all MMS connectivity depending on the phone. As others have mentioned, the only way to receive a MMS directed toward the number serviced by your carrier is for you to be connected to their service.  However, you might consider a service such as Google Voice.  Google Voice provides an alternative number that is then routed to your phone.  Currently Google Voice only supports SMS, but there may be other services that offer MMS support.  A SMS message sent to your Google Voice number would then be visible in the Google Voice app, even if you only have a WiFi connection.','Can I send / retrieve MMS messages via WiFi?',7,None

Open Clock
Tap "Alarms" icon at the bottom of the screen
I must enter my pattern to access alarms
Do anything else in Clock
 ?
Exiting Clock requires entering lock pattern

This happened once before, but I don't remember what I did to fix it, or even if I did anything (it might have just fixed itself).
Had anyone else had this problem? What did you do to fix it?
Edit: The screen is locking when the main Clock screen (Activity?) is displayed. Exiting from Alarms (for example) doesn't require unlocking the phone again.
Edit (2011-12-20): My solution was to download Alarm Clock Launcher and just bypass opening Clock. My Optimus still has this issue; we'll see if I end up having it on my new Motorola Triumph. I haven't figured out what the problem was, but I did find a workaround for my particular use case: Install Alarm Clock Launcher (donate version).
That way, I can change the alarm clock settings without having to unlock my device twice. I had the same problem. Phone screen used to get locked when i tried to access clock(from widget or from home.) Had to disable the lock pattern.
Anyhow, my solution:

goto -> setting -> applications -> Manage Applications -> Running -> Clock

I'm working on rooting my android kernel and most sites list http://android-dls.com/files/linux/fastboot as the place to look for the fastboot binary. However, I've been getting a 404 (Page not Found) error when attempting to access this site.
Does anyone know of an alternate download location for fastboot?
I'm currently running Ubuntu Linux. HTC used to have a copy of the Linux binary, but they changed their developers portal and now I can't find that one anymore, either. The only other pre-compiled version I've been able to find is here (link originated from this thread on droidforums.net, which also has a link to a pre-compiled OSX binary).
I checked with readelf on my Linux VM and it looks like it's a 64-bit binary, so I've also uploaded a 32-bit version to my Dropbox public folder, and it can be downloaded here. This is the binary I use on my machine, which I believe I got from the aforementioned HTC site that's now missing.
Aside from that, you can compile Android from source to get it...but that's kind of a terrible solution for a single small binary file. The Replicant Project builds tools with every release; you can find their tools here (go down the directory tree in a path like replicant-2.3/preview/0002/tools/), along with notes about which git version was used for the source. Go one directory up and read COPYING for details.
Note: They only offer Linux builds.
Source code is here. You want the Android SDK.  From the CyanogenMod wiki:

After installing the Android SDK or ADB Standalone you can use 'fastboot' in addition to the more common ADB.

After installing the SDK you will need to add the Android SDK platform-tools package. Here it is: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=11347040&postcount=105','Anyone have an alternative dowload site for a fastboot binary?',5,link link link link link link link link link link

Now I have a stock alarm clock application.
Yesterday evening I set my alarm for 6:30am, but got up at 10 being 2h+ late for my work.
When I took my phone, I noticed 3 things

it was showing a message like "Adobe Flash Player cannot be installed without internet connection";
second thing I noted is "Low on space" notification --- common problem for HTC Desire;
my alarm was silently asking me if I want to snooze or dismiss it.

I want

to have an alarm clock on my phone as stable as my bicycle, i.e. which

works as expected;
does not turn off automatically after 1, 5, 10 or 100500 minutes;
does not stop working in case of update or any other event (except airplane mode);

to have Android update like Debian Squeeze, i.e. not to update automatically (at least if it causes problems), but gently suggest to install only security critical updates and to give any other suggestions only by special request;
some logging for my alarm to "debug" problems with waking up.

In the list above I mention not only the alarm, but the whole system (Android update), because I think that tuning off the system can help to stabilize my alarm. Correct me if I'm wrong.
Question

What can be done to make my system and, importantly, my alarm, very stable?
What is the most stable alarm clock app?
Is there any way to make it even more stable (for instance, turn off updates to stick with a stable version)?

What is done
I have found the following relevant threads:

"Is there an alarm clock event log?" has no satisfactory answer;
"Which Alarm clock app do you use to wake up in the morning?" suggests Smart Alarm Clock and Gentle Alarm, a similar thread suggests Alarm Clock Xtreme (ad-supported or paid ($2)); I do not have any information on stability of these;
the following threads about alarm clock incidents: [1], [2];
"disable update notification" - done.

Future
Probably at some point I will reinstall Android with a question of solving low internal memory problem in mind. So if there are some solutions for a different version of Android (say 2.3) or advice for installation to make my system and alarm stable I would like to know them.
Update
As roxan pointed out, probably alarm rings just for a few minutes. If it is so, I would like to turn off this feature or set this time to something big (2 hours or more). I also use Desire and this has never/ever happened to me under any circumstances. Alarm would not work if you had killed it but you have clearly specified you don't have any task killer.
As you said there is Snooze/Dismiss screen, the alarm indeed went on. Are you sure you didn't miss when the alarm rang at the correct time? Or are you sure the volume is loud enough?','How to make my alarm as stable as a server?',2,link link link link link link link link link link link

It will show the list of SMS senders, but when I click one to see their messages I get blocked by this popup:

Of course I checked right away to see if I was using too much memory.  I went to Menu->Settings->SD & Phone Storage and saw I have plenty of space:
SD card - Available space: 5.72GB
Internal phone storage - Available space: 6.25GB

I have more free memory than used memory so that can't be the problem.  I tried restarting my phone as well but no change in message.  I also Googled the problem and among all the "me too" responses found that other have this problem where SMS is blocked even though they have plenty of memory.
I couldn't get a clear resolution and I'm worried the answers are now out of date.  ZDNet published a couple of articles on the issue:
Have I solved my Droid Incredible storage problem?
Is your Droid Incredible low on disk space?
Both suggest this is HTC's fault and that there is no fix.  They say you can try clearing the cache on HTC's apps like Peep, Messages and Mail and also advise clearing the cache on your browsers.
I've tried these techniques, but they didn't work.
Does anyone know what causes this and what solutions exist? The Droid Incredible's available space for apps to store their data is only 150 MB, but it's impossible to view the amount of free app space on the stock ROM.  So the error message is correct, but you have no way to view the available free space.
In technical terms: /data/data is mounted on a different partition than /data, and all your free space views show you the amount of free space in the 750 MB /data partition.
What you need to do is start clearing data for spps that are taking up lots of space and that you don't use often.  One possibility is clearing the web browser's cache.  Facebook is another big data hog.  Check your other installed apps to see how much space they are using on data.
Here's a dump of the df -h output on my Inc:

(Note: I'm running a recent Cyanogenmod build that allows for swapping the SD Card and internal storage mount points -- that's why /mnt/sdcard is showing up as 6.6G while /mnt/emmc is only 1.8G.)
You can see how /data is a 750MB partition with plenty of free space, while /data/data is a teensy 150MB partition that's over half full.
This XDA Thread has a flashable mod that will make /data/data a subfolder of /data rather than a separate mount point, unlocking all that 750MB for app storage and allowing all your free space views to be accurate.  You'll need to root your phone in order for this to work since it also converts the filesystems to ext4 and that's going to require a replacement kernel.  (Recent Cyanogenmod builds already have this support, but if you're running the stock ROM you'll need to flash a different kernel.) To wipe the cache partition (this will not delete your data or apps):

Boot into recovery
Press and hold Power, Choose "Restart" option
When screen turns off, press and hold Volume Down and Power
When the white HBOOT screen appears, use the volume button to move down to RECOVERY.
Press the Power button to select RECOVERY.
When the Green Arrows and\or triangle and exclamation appears, hold the Volume Up and Power button at the same time.
Using the volume button, scroll down to Wipe cache partition and select it (power button).
Select "Reboot system now"

Now you have enough space to download and install the additional update. Verizon released 2 updates for the HTC Incredible, I'm guessing you only got one. Go to Settings> About Phone> Software> Build - 4.06 right? there is a 4.08 that seems to resolve this Low on Space problem.
To get that update immediately (recommend connecting to WiFi first for the download):
Go to Settings> Date\Time> Uncheck Automatic and manually set your clock ahead 1 month
Then go to Settings> About Phone> System Updates and it should be there waiting for you.

Towards this end, what's the best way to create a dedicated homescreen page for the app?  Is it possible to create an app with a large homescreen icon, or do we have to build a "widget"? This is, on the other hand, a dev question but it still is pretty practical, so I'll answer it here. The icons are pretty much standard sized in all the launchers, so there could be two other options: a widget or a background + icon.
Since the devices will be dedicated to the app, it's possible to design a background to suit the full screen size, but still emphasize the icon. 
The other possibility is to create a widget with the sole purpose of launching the app, which requires a bit more work, but gives the possibility of enhancing the  home screen with additional features in the future with the codebase you already have.','Building a large home screen icon',2,None

It is so easy to get a 6to4 tunnel on Linux.. Just install aiccu and then aiccu start. On Windows there is gogoClient which is also quite easy.
I tested IPv6config but my phone does not work out of the box and the author seems more interested in a proof of concept rather than supporting all phones. He does not reply to my e-mails, and after Googling this app it seems that I am the only one using it.
Are there any working ways to setup a 6to4 IPv6 tunnel on Android? The title of this post says "6to4 (NAT traversal)". This is fundamentally impossible. It does not work on your standard Linux, let alone Android. The 6to4 protocol relies on having a public IPv4 address on the same machine you terminate the tunnel on.
Leaving that aside, it may be that you are simply using the word "6to4" when in fact you mean "IPv6 tunnelling". Other tools, such as AICCU or gogoc, utilise different protocols that encapsulate IPv6 within UDP within IPv4 to allow the NAT traversal to work. These do not use 6to4.
Your Android distribution must support the necessary kernel modules for tunnelling to work. You must have the sit module available for 6to4 (or the tun module for many VPN products, and so on and so forth) as well as the ability to add tunnels such as via ip tunnel add mode sit. It may be that you do not have that available.
I have a device (Motorola Milestone running CM7) that is supported by the IPv6Config app you mentioned above. The app does not appear to do anything phone-specific. I suspect that the fundamental problem is that simply having "root" on your phone is not enough  your Android must ship with the appropriate kernel modules.
You may need to run another distro (e.g. CyanogenMod instead of a rooted stock Android) that includes the proper support to allow such tunnelling to work. Digging out an old post but it might be helpful for others:
I just wrote a small app called Androiccu that is available in the Google Play Store:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.web_troubles.androiccu
This app allows an easy way to download aiccu (and a complete version of ip, both not ported to Android by me), configure it and finally run it. Of course your phone must be rooted and must have the tun kernel module. There is an app called tun.ko that can help you add the tun kernel module if it is not present.
It's still in an early development stage but have fun testing it and reporting failure or success.

I've built a stock version from the AOSP and tried a few different times to flash it on my Droid X, all unsuccessful. I was thinking (or hoping) that the process of rooting the device would also unlock it to allow this, but maybe that's not the case. It looks like the phone still can't be touched at kernel level.
Anyone know what's up here? There's a lot of ROMs for the DX, so it seems like there's a way, or do all those ROMs modify only a superficial level of the Verizon image? I just want to know what's going on under the covers. eldarerathis is right, you'd need to build the Droid X source in order for it to just work without modification.  Drivers are the main issue here; unlike Windows, for example, Android does not include a vast number of drivers to enable it to work on most any hardware.  Android also runs on much less standardized hardware than PCs.
Most ROMs you see tend to be modifications of the stock image, possibly with custom kernels built from stock.

Build number 1.47.401.4

Today I've got notification that an update is available for my phone with:

HTC Sence 3.0
Android 2.3.5

I've downloaded the update and started it. My phone rebooted, then for several seconds I saw green icon showing that update is going. After that I've received the red exclamation mark icon. I've triggered the recover console and saw the following:
Finding update package...
Opening update package...

(Status 7)
Installation aborted.

As far as I understood from the log, the CRC failed for the EReader.apk. Does that mean that the updated downloaded incorrectly? Or maybe there are some issues with my phone?
Can someone, please, help me with this issue:

Should I forget about this update and wait for the next one?
Is it the bug in the system or in my phone?
Can I somehow (without rooting the device) overcome the problem and install the update?
Any other thoughts are welcome. Thank you. Mostly likely the update over the air downloaded the wrong archive, which failed to automatically install. In addition to that I found on several forums that the phone had many broken stuff after such update. Therefore I've decided to update it manually.
I've downloaded the zip archive with latest official firmware, put it on my sdcard, rebooted the phone into recover console. It automatically found my zip archive and the phone was updated. Everything works fine now.
The complete instructions together with latest firmware can be found here (Russian language): http://www.youhtc.ru/forum/showthread.php?p=304305&posted=1#post304305
I've translated them in short below:

Download the zip archive with RUU_Saga_S_HTC_Europe_2.10.401.8_Radio_20.4801.30. 0822U_3822.10.08.04_M_release_225161_signed.exe from here
Rename the zip archive to PG88IMG.zip and put it in the root directory on sd card
Power off the phone
Press volume-down button and then power button.
The recovery console will pop up. The phone will automatically find the zip file and check it. It will ask you to confirm the update. If you're OK with that, the phone will be updated. I believe your downloaded update file is broken somehow. 
Further notice:!! manual operations always have the risk to brick your phone. So be careful, and remember I take no responsibility.
You can manually update with rom update utility (RUU). RUU is a PC program that updates your phone through usb connection.
You should backup all your information first.

'http___android_stackexchange_com_questions_164.html',64,'rooting','Are there any risks to rooting a device? I see lots of tutorials telling me how to root my phone (Motorola Droid), but none of them mention any potential "side effects."
Aside from a few relatively minor issues that seem to require rooting to fix, I'm basically happy with the phone and therefore a little leery of messing with a device that cost me a lot of money and is only a few months old.
Assuming that I'm just talking about rooting, and none of the typical post-root actions (like installing a custom ROM), am I taking any risks by choosing to root?

Does it have the potential to brick the device?
Will it void my warranty?
Will I stop getting updates?
Will the cops show up at my front door the next day? (Yes, I'm being facetious.)
Anything else I should be aware of?

(See also: Are there any risks to flashing a ROM?) Does it have the potential to brick the device? 
Although it has become relatively simple on the Droid, some methods of rooting pose more risk than others. So in short yes there is a potential.
Will it void my warranty? 
Yes technically this does void your warranty in most cases.
Will I stop getting updates?
No, unless you install a third party  ROM these will usually continue to come in and may unroot your phone if you install them.
Will the cops show up at my front door the next day?
I certainly hope not ;) but if rooting involves cracking a bootloader, it could theoretically get you in legal trouble in some jurisdictions (anti-circumvention laws, etc.)
EDIT:  Also be aware that there are different root methods based on which current build you are running. Does it have the potential to brick the device?

Yes, it is possible to brick your phone, but should be very unlikely.  Usually there is a way out of even what seems to be a brick.
If you do not know what you are doing and want to use the ADB method (entering shell commands manually) to root your phone, then be sure to follow all of the directions exactly as listed. If you somehow brick your phone, then it does not matter how good your phone insurance is with your cell provider; if they find out you rooted or attempted to, they will not fix it.
If you do somehow brick your phone, then do not panic.  Try these things:

Post a thread to where you downloaded the root program or where the root method was posted.
Post to XDA under their questions and answers section.
Search the web. Someone else has probably had the same problem as you.

It is quite possible to unbrick your phone, but it will take some time and patience to sort it out.

Will it void my warranty?

Yes. But in most cases you can restore your phone to a condition that they'll never know that you rooted your phone.  And sometimes they do not even check to see if you rooted your phone when you return it.

Will I stop getting updates?

Yes and no.  If you flash a rom, yes.  But most likely that rom has constant updates (such as CyanogenMod).  Also if you root and keep stock rom, you will still get OTA update notifications (but running an update will un-root your phone).

Anything else I should be aware of?

May the force be with you.  No, really, it's a relatively painless process with a lot of these "easy one touch (un)root tools" and even then there is a plethora of guides and help from XDA to guide you and troubleshoot any problems you might have.  But if you are happy with your phone just the way it is, then don't root. Rooted phones are just as secure as an unrooted phones if you never grant root permission to any apps. The problem is that if you root your phone, you're bound to give root permission (otherwise, why are you rooting your phone in the first place), and applications that you give root permission may turned out to be rogue or leak their permission to allow an untrusted applications to gain root-like permission. 
Running rooted phone is safe as long as you know which app to give root access and which are not. Problem is, even assuming that you only pick trustworthy apps they still can leak permissions inadvertantly (in security parlance, this is called confused deputy problem), so you must really be careful when choosing trusted apps. Some malwares can escalate to root permissions even on a un-rooted phone. Like the one they just recently found in over 50 (popular) apps on the android market.
http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/221247/droiddream_becomes_android_market_nightmare.html Does it have the potential to brick the device?

Yes.
Will it void my warranty?

Definitely.
Will I stop getting updates?

Yes, if you install a custom ROM.
Will the cops show up at my front door the next day?

Yes, but only if you're Chinese ;-). And even then, only if your police administration is near enough to Beijing.
And you should be aware that it is a security risk. A root user has access to the entire phone, including all of its functionality, and the memory of all running applications. A backdoor could be installed in a custom ROM. It might not even be to your disadvantage, but your phone might become part of a botnet.','Are there any risks to rooting a device?',6,link link link link link link code code code code

So the question is, what sort of workarounds are there for this? 
For example, could I log in to android market from the recipients phone with my google credentials, buy and then download the application, then logout again? Would the application still work? Can I pay with my credit card with the other persons Google wallet? Is this consistent with the usage policy of the Android market? What other options might I have? For some apps, you could buy it on your account, then give them the APK, but this won't work for all apps, as many of them contact the market to make sure they've been paid for. That also might not be entirely legal. At the moment, I think the only option you really have is just to give them the money to buy it. Apps are tied to the account; so while the app may work they wouldn't be able to get it back if they uninstalled it, reset the phone, etc. There is no simple, good way to do what you want currently.','Workaround needed: Buying an application for someone else in the Android Market',3,None

Is there a way to assign the existing ordinary contact  for me (a contact with my name and details that I sometimes use for sharing with people, and sync with Picasa Photos etc.) to this slot?
It seems related to this question, but that is about the similar HTC specific feature found on some phones. After trying forever (the "me" profile was never synced and could not be merged), this worked for me:
Install the Google+ app.
Set it to sync contacts.
Open your contacts again; your contact will now be set as "my profile".
Seriously.

The "me" contact can be synced with third party apps ( Google+, HaxSync... ) but for an unknow reason you can't merge a "normal" contact with the "me" contact... Maybe with Jelly Bean the problem will be solved. Not quite the same as "existing contact", but upon installing the Google+ app the phone synced the "Me" contact with everything in my Google+ profile.  This was on my Galaxy Nexus on ICS 4.0.4 with the latest Google+ app. Pull up the contact, open the menu and choose edit, then open the menu on that screen and choose join.

I thought the system app would be restored, but the fact is now. I don't have a "desktop". I cant get to anywhere now on my phone, it is just one big black screen. Anyway that I could fix it? Thanks a million. Your best bet would be to reflash the ROM, since system reset only clears the user data, it won't restore system apps. A quick google search revealed this tutorial on how to reflash stock ROM: How to flash Original Firmware on the LG Optimus One P500 As long as your Google account still is configured on the device (and the latter is connected to either WiFi or the mobile network), the simplest solution would be to visit the Google Playstore, log in with the same account you're using on your Android device, chose an alternative launcher app (e.g. Holo Launcher), hit the "Install" button, and approve its permissions. A few minutes later, the app should be installed on your device -- and you again have a working home-screen.
There's a big mis-conception about factory-reset, as the name is misleading: It won't reset to "as shipped from the factory", but simply remove all settings and user-installed apps -- so it looks like "fresh from a factory".

How can I achieve the same thing on Android
For example:

update my podcasts by calling pcastclient /updateALL
force sync of my pictures sugarsync /forceupdate Android's shell will support a limited amount of Unix-style shell scripting. It specifically should have a shell at /system/bin/sh that you can use, however:

The shell provided with Android has a severely restricted set of commands available to it. If you want to do anything even remotely complex you'll need a busybox install (or another shell).
It's generally pretty rare for Android apps to provide any kind of command line interface or binaries. I very much doubt that Sugarsync, for example, allows you to perform a sync from the command line.

If you want a bit of a GUI you may want to look at something like GScript. There are a few Android apps that are able to control other Android apps, and can chain several commands together using their GUI in a similar way to a script, they both have plugins to extend their support to many popular Android apps and functions.
Tasker and Locale are probably the most famous of these (see here for some comparison) but there are also other similar (free) apps that you could look at.','On Android can I write scripts (similar to Win .bat files) to combine several command line commands?',3,link link link link link link link

When i have tabs opened no matter in which browser and restore back to that browser due to previous multi-tasking, i get all tabs reloading (or would it be more correct to say, loading again from scratch?).
I thought when multi-tasking, tabs are supposed to leave at state they previously were in. So when certain websites were already loaded, why would they reload again and consume bandwidth?
UPDATE: Here is my device's memory status (sorry for bad quality but until Android implements screenshot feature in stock ROM or until i decide to ROOT, i will be capturing with another device's low quality camera):



Where are the rest of 499MB of memory? My device notifies me of low memory but what about the rest of 499MB? And did i mention that HTC Sense force closes when i multi-task? It happens when tab is unloaded from memory.
Your thinking for multitasking is right, but just for multitasking, Android can't let device crashing happen, for example (device hardware resources are limited). There are many things which should be given higher priority than a background app. When foreground app needs high amount of memory, background apps are unloaded fully or partially from memory. Technically, when free memory drops below certain level, attack on background apps is performed. In fact, foreground app can also be attacked when kernel runs out of memory.
When it comes to websites, web browsers often make request of removed things of website (which aren't available in disc cache). To re-construct a web page, its better to reload webpage.
You can check it with Dolphin Browser HD: Send it to background & disconnect from internet. Then, re-open it. Webpage will be reloaded, but using cache (mind it, there's no internet connection).','Why Browser Tabs Reload After Restoring Back From Multi-Tasking?',2,picture picture picture
'http___android_stackexchange_com_questions_21296.html',12,'wi-fi','How can I find out the Wi-Fi password from android setting I have an android phone which is connected to a secured Wi-Fi hotpot.
How can I find out what is the password of the Wi-Fi hotpot from the phone. On my phone, the credentials are stored in /data/wifi/bcm_supp.conf.  You'll probably need root to see it directly on your phone but you may be able to use adb pull (requires the Android SDK) from your PC to get the file.
As noted in the comments, the location may vary based on your ROM or device (specifically the Wi-Fi chip; mine's a Broadcom).  Check /data/wifi/, /data/etc/wifi/ and /data/misc/wifi/ for relevant config files if you don't find the ones suggest by eldarerathis or I. On CyanogenMod devices, and possibly other AOSP ROMs, you should be able to grab it from the /data/misc/wifi/wpa_supplicant.conf file. On a non-rooted device I don't think this is possible since you won't have permission to read the /data directories where the settings are stored and the Settings menu simply displays (Unchanged) if you go into the network configuration.
This is what I see on my CM7 EVO (network name and password redacted):
# cd /data/misc/wifi/
# ls

# more wpa_supplicant.conf

im trying to fix a friends phone GT-I9000.
basically i get error in mounting sdcard. 
after searching endlessly and installing 100s of stock rom. still no luck.
i assume that the partition on my internal sd card is corrupted.
i have come across this thread.
http://forum.xda-developers.com/show....php?t=1253036
im hoping i can reset my partition on the sdcard.
but i can't get su permission on android sdk adb shell command
phone is in clockwork recovery mod when running the adb commands
i.e. this is the code i have to do..
adb shell
mount /sdcard
su
parted /dev/block/mmcblk0
rm 1
rm 2
rm 3
quit

but it ends up like...
adb shell
~ $ mount /sdcard
mount /sdcard
mount: permission denied (are you root?)
~ $

the su command it not recongised.... any ideas?
the phone will not boot into any rom. only option is recovery or download mode.
i have rooted it with CF-ROOT, which in turn installs CWM
therefore i can't install or turn on debugging
HELP please!!!!!!!! Quoting your code:
adb shell
mount /sdcard
su

And now your output:
adb shell
~ $ mount /sdcard
mount /sdcard
mount: permission denied (are you root?)

it becomes quite clear why your su is not recognized: it comes too late. You need to move it one line up, as mount already requires root. Still, that would launch another shell, and wait for your input. Once you exit, the remaining commands would be executed. So correctly put, it should look like this:
adb shell
su mount /sdcard

So this part would work. The next part is something completely different:
su parted /dev/block/mmcblk0
rm 1
rm 2
rm 3
quit

The first line is your command. But the remaining lines are no shell commands, but the input to parted, so this needs to be handled differently:
su parted /dev/block/mmcblk0 <<MyCommandsHere
rm 1
rm 2
rm 3
quit
MyCommandsHere

That's a so-called Here-Doc.','adb su permission denied, no rom, rooted, need to fix internal sd card',2,link code code link code code code code code

How can I get word completion with physical keyboard? 

Is there anyway to get spell check functionality while using the drop down keyboard? Most keyboards come with suggestions for common words, so a spell check function is rendered moot. Once a user types a couple of letters, the most common words containing those letters usually show up in a bar above the on screen keyboard.
Most keyboards like Smart Keyboard / Better keyboard also have options that allow for word suggestion to show up if a user opts for the hardware keyboard instead of the "soft" on-screen keyboard.','Spell Check app or setting while using drop down keyboard [duplicate]',2,link
