Title: Suggesting Improvements to Questions and Answers 

Can we improve upon existing answers within the stack exchange system?
Can we help people try to answer questions?
Can we help improve questions?

Task:
1- correlates the score/rank with the question/answer pair text, what's the content (picture, code, etc.)
Given an answer, predicting its score

Data:
Stack Exchange

Technique:
Language model that incorporates question and answer together. N grams work very well when you look at 1 text. Therefore, we
need to find a representation that links the two texts (question/answer) together. 
We need to find a good representation.
Linguistic ideas:
List of interrogatives in English
Interrogative position
- Part of stack exchange shows editing that has been, what has been added/deleted could be useful. 
Ex:
You should do...
Change to -->
You should try...
Ex: 
If we see Christian replaced by Roman catholic 100 times..system will suggest replacement

Rank our predictions and see if it performs better, if it does suggest it. How strongly
can we correlate the data with the answer? Done without understanding. 

Data representations:
- word pairs could be some feature of a representation
- Using trigrams that were ranked as good answers
