LPC works by digitising the analog signal and splitting it into segments. For each of the segments we determine the key features of the signal and try to encode these as accurately as possible. The key features are the pitch of the signal (i.e. the basic formant frequency), the loudness of the signal and whether the sound is voiced or unvoiced. Parameters called vocal tract excitation parameters are also determined which are used in the vocal tract model to better model the state of the vocal tract which generated the sound. This data is passed over the network and decoded at the receiver. The pitch of the signal is used as input to either a voiced or unvoiced synthesiser, and the loudness data is used to boost the amplitude of this resulting signal. Finally the vocal cord model filters this sound by applying the LPC coefficients which were sent over the network.

- In Limited, your "sideboard" consists of all the cards from your pool that you didn't put in your deck, plus an unlimited supply of basic lands, should you need them. - You don't have to make 1-for-1 substitutions when sideboarding. So, for instance, if I don't like how my deck runs 17/40 lands but fear 18/40 would be excessive, I can "side in" a land without removing anything to go up to 18/41 lands. The only restriction is that your final deck still has to be legal (i.e. no less than 40 cards). - You don't have to "restore" your deck to any particular starting configuration for game 1 of each match. So there's no need to remember your starting configuration or undo a sideboard choice if you realized that it just runs better than your original 40-card list.

wasn't a hundred percent pure, it should not affect your mixture in such a way . The reason why your turkish delights turned wrong is more likely the fact you used FRUIT JUICE. When using agar agar to make candy or firmer gel bases, it is not recommended to use fruit juice since it contains acids wich makes the agar unable to set properly. If you want to make turkish delights with agar, I believe you better use flavoring and coloring... I would even say you should use these in any recipe wich involves agar agar,unless otherwise specified. You

Seeds germinated after 2 weeks but toke a few months to establish. The cover or pathchiness was a function of how much seed I put down. Also the young grass is less hardy so you need to keep your dogs/kids/relatives off until it is established.

He was a former member of Saddam Hussein's government, who was later put in charge of the "de-Baath-ification" of the Iraqi government after Saddam had been captured. He was (and still has been) an outspoken supporter of both the United States and Israel, and was (and probably still has been) told repeatedly by those in the government that if he would simply stop speaking out in support of Israel, he would be given the full backing of the Iraqi leadership. Instead, he continued to speak out on Israel's behalf, and was stripped of his security detail, threatened with death, and lost his two sons in a bomb attack meant to kill him. I was asked to help, not with security or money or connections  these were all things he was handling on his own  but simply

The Rav Ovadia would say that it is not only not casher for kidush but we say sheacol to drink. Because of this, today many wineries print that their wine/juice is also casher for havdala and kidush as the opinion of the maran habet iosef

Both are used, but I believe linguists prefer the former. Grammaticality, as one linguist explained it to me, means "following the rules of the relevant scientific model that is used to describe how people speak". So it is strictly dependent on the model used, but in practice many linguists presume that there is consensus about most elements of the relevant model, so it mostly overlaps with "people actually use this within a certain group and they consider it normal".

472

The word "incorrect" may suggest that there is something wrong with straying from grammatically; I suspect that linguists do not use this much because they resent the implication. So I think that's why you will mostly see ungrammatical.

a leak that allows rain water to collect in the car. Check to see if the rugs are damp,look in the storage well behind the seat and any place water might collect. Do you also notice a sweet smell when the engine gets warm? If you do it may be a leaking heater core. Antifreeze could be leaking into the heater box then the vapor is fogging the windshield. Antifreeze residue can be difficult to remove from the windsshield. Try rubbing a clean tissue on the inside of the glass. The tissue may show the oily component of the antifreeze.It may be a small leak as a little antifreeze goes along way in terms of fogging the glass. The third source could be the A/C. The A/C unit removes humidity from the air. This is what causes the puddle under the car when the A/C is running. Sometimes the drain get clogged with leaves or pine needles. This allows the water to build up which adds humidity when you run the defroster. If enough has collected you may hear it sloshing under the dash when you make a turn.

--As in, how can past experience help us if what we are applying the rule to is something unexperienced? It could seem as though we need to follow a rule to follow a rule (an infinite regression). That is, there would be a certain rule for applying rules by some similarity of circumstances; of course, it gets somewhat tricky for something like mathematics--where we often change the elements of the system to build foundations (e.g. the change in the concept of number that Dedekind and Canton brought about), and thus, are still expected to follow certain rules in new (but perhaps analogous) circumstances. (To identify situational analogs seems to be another sort of rule following.) The point is that it seems our minds "fill in the blanks," so to speak, of what is unknown by what we know. But it's also unclear why there is certainty when we apply a rule to new sets of problems.

"Suppose that a judge or magistrate is faced with rioters demanding that a culprit be found for a certain crime and threatening otherwise to take their own bloody revenge on a particular section of the community. The real culprit being unknown, the judge sees himself as able to prevent the bloodshed only by framing some innocent person and having him executed. Beside this example is placed another in which a pilot whose aeroplane is about to crash is deciding whether to steer from a more to a less inhabited area. To make the parallel as close as possible it may rather be supposed that he is the driver of a runaway tram which he can only steer from one narrow track on to another; five men are working on one track and one man on the other; anyone on the track he enters is bound to be killed. In the case of the riots the mob have five hostages, so that in both the exchange is supposed to be one man's life for the lives of five."

I think even currently mass loss due to the solar wind is orders of magnitude greater
85

e=m*c**2
$E=mc^2$
6

than mass loss due to e=m*c**2. But even so it isn't much. Ideally you would have enough mass loss, so that a planets radius would increase at just that rate that kept the stars luminosity divided by r squared constant, i.e. if that were the case the planet would stay within the habitable zone, even as the star brightened due to stellar evolution. Alas the solar wind is much too weak to accomplish the task. But we should be moving further out in any case.

One can argue formally using the AdS/CFT correspondence that black hole formation and evaporation does not destroy information, contrary to earlier claims by Hawking that it must. This was the basis for Hawking's payoff of a bet he made with John Preskill. The bet, and a brief discussion of some of the issues involved can be found here
337

Important caveats are that there is no proof of AdS/CFT (although at this point it is very hard to believe it is not correct) and that the argument really doesn't tell one very explicitly just how the information manages to be encoded in the outgoing Hawking radiation.

In the continuum limit,Assuming that the field occupy a finite volume , What is the effect of the boundry conditions on the dynamics of the field ?

We introduce a blocking and regularization approach to estimate high-dimensional covariances using high-frequency data. Assets are first grouped according to liquidity. Using the multivariate realized kernel estimator of Barndorff-Nielsen et al. (2010), the covariance matrix is estimated block-wise and then regularized. The performance of the resulting blocking and regularization (RnB) estimator is analyzed in an extensive simulation study mimicking the liquidity and market microstructure features of the S&P 1500 universe. The RnB estimator yields efficiency gains for varying liquidity settings, noise-to-signal ratios and dimensions. An empirical application of estimating daily covariances of the S&P 500 index confirms the simulation results.

The party is traveling a long road and is accosted by bandits. They battle the band of bandits and defeat them, finding a letter from a nearby town instructing the bandits to steal for them. The players head for this town with ample opportunity to have an extended rest.

270

The party is solving a mystery. A classic who-done-it with many characters and sub-plots but only one murderer, whom they finally confront and fight. If the murderer had an army in his command, it would be incongruous with the rest of the plot.

the Doctor freezing Gallifrey
so many Doctors show up
25

, the Doctor(s) decide that instead of destroying Gallifrey, they should freeze it. Now for some reason, this involved ALL the Doctor's incarnations to perform some calculations that would take hundreds of years. However, why did this involve the Doctors 1-8 (I can understand why Capaldi came in as he is the future Doctor so maybe he comes back to help out or something)? Also, the idea of Doctors 1-8 performing these calculations that'll freeze the TARDIS may be plausible as they may have been doing so without realizing,but then why did all of the Tardis' (all 13 TARDIS') appear at the point where the 3 doctors in the main episode freeze Gallifrey. Shouldn't the Doctors 1-8 have had no involement at all as they are the past?

In the 1950 encyclical humani generis, Pope Pius XII confirmed that there is no intrinsic conflict between Christianity and the theory of evolution, provided that Christians believe that the individual soul is a direct creation by God and not the product of purely material forces.

There is a small velocity gain from the air launch. This isn't significant, but is there.
Falcon 1 is a LOX/RP liquid propellant rocket whereas Pegasus is solid rocket based. The technologies have vastly different thrust/weight ratios, specific impulse, and mass fractions. Solid rockets tend to have higher mass fractions and T/W because the engines are less complex (i.e. no pressurization systems, or plumbing, or turbo-pump machinery. But solids are typically more expensive, and typically have fixed impulse burns (i.e. they cannot be turned off). This is less of an issue for early stages, but the reason the Pegasus added the optional HAPS (hydrazine) final stage for precision orbit insertion.
538

The Pegasus doesn't have to worry about changing inclinations, as the Falcon 9 does. But the specified numbers for Falcon 1 don't take in to account a varied inclination.
Because it is air-launched Pegasus can fly a different trajectory. Instead of a low angle-of-attack ascent followed by a gravity turn, Pegasus has wings. It flies at positive angle of attack and uses lift to aid in ascent.
166

There is considerably less drag at 40,000 feet.
Engines at altitude can use a more efficient engine design (i.e. rocket nozzle expansion ratios tuned to atmospheric pressure at drop vice sea level.
122

You are 10 km higher at altitude. This probably isn't significant.

1)  Don't load them - There are a number of problems I've uncovered with a web application where the DLL's and other such objects were not loaded in memory first.  Two concurrent users hitting the app at the same time before all files were "spun up" created some really strange concurrency issues that only happened in that instance.  If the purpose of your testing is to check these initialization conditions under load, then definitely don't load them DLL's first. 2)  Load them up - For many applications, the application has been up and running for a while the next time someone hits it so most general performance testing is most "realistic" when the DLL's are pre-loaded.

Based on following
If I create and dispose my

sample
multiple times, on each creation I noticed, due to typed factory, a big memory allocation(200kb for this

internal static class ContainerBuilder {     public static IWindsorContainer Build()//string configPath     {         IWindsorContainer container = new WindsorContainer();             // add array resolver             container.Kernel.Resolver.AddSubResolver(new ArrayResolver(container.Kernel));             container.AddFacility<TypedFactoryFacility>();             container.Register             (                 Component.For<CustomTypedFactoryComponentSelector, ITypedFactoryComponentSelector>(),                 AllTypes.FromThisAssembly()                     .BasedOn<Contracts.IConverter>().WithService.Base()                         .Configure(c => c.Named("o"+c.Implementation.Name))                     .Configure(c=>c.LifeStyle.Singleton),                 Component.For<Contracts.IConverterFactory>().AsFactory(c => c.SelectedWith<CustomTypedFactoryComponentSelector>()),                  Component.For<ConverterHelper1>().LifeStyle.Transient             );           return container;     } }
W/o factory autogeneration memory grows much slower.

. The Shapiro-Wilk doesn't look at the dependence in consecutive values. The most noticeable effect of the dependence on the distribution of the order statistics will be to increase their variance, but the Shapiro Wilk won't notice that at all. There will be a tendency for the tails to wander more from the straight line than with an independent series and eventually that sort of deviation will become detectable

Eye movement studies have been done in excess to determine the best placement for the most important call-to-action buttons.  And users often start in the upper-left hand corner.  On the other hand, these window buttons are so ubiquitous and so familiar that they shouldn't require unnecessary thought.  If a user is accustomed to an OS with the buttons on a certain side of the screen they will naturally be looking for them in that spot.  Past experience is going to be the dominant factor in what the user expects.

Thanks!
For instance Google may try to search for specific pages from its cache on the old domain and any related errors will show up for you old domain. In addition, you will still see some page ranking returns for the old domain for at least 2 weeks afterwords, if not even longer.  This seems odd to me but I am assuming it is Google's caching system and if you do all of your redirects correctly it will not be an issue.

Maybe this works for you
Here's another solution to not mess with the edit slug button

Notice that I don't filter the link,

like this solution but maybe it works for you
34

There's a filter called 'page_link'
This was much more confusing than I thought
34

It will filter what is shown in the admin
Maybe this works for you.
32

// only replace the first occurence
$page_link

preg_replace('/%pagename%/',
.=
28

>post_name, $page_link, 1);
>post_name;

str_replace(

.=

$parent
$page

>post_name, $page_link );
>post_name;
