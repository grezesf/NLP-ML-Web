'http___academia_stackexchange_com_questions_10695.html',13,'publishing collaboration fees','Splitting publication fees among coauthors','What are accepted ways of splitting publication fees among coauthors when authors are from different research groups and potentially even different institutions Especially with open access publication the fees tend to come out at a substantial amount In general the corresponding author seems to be responsible to the journal for the payment of the fee I wonder what would be commonly acceptable agreements with coauthors to split such fees There is already a general question on splitting collaboration costs here but the current answer does not apply to publication fees and I am really interested in this specific case ','I think your question is a little backwards All ways of splitting the publication fees are acceptable You might run into some problems with your grant officer about transferring money around but in the end they will get over it The more important question in my opinion is What behaviour is acceptable from you and your co authors I believe the answer is to be nice since these are your co authors after all I wouldn t be too put off if a co author refused to contribute to open access fees or if I was asked to contribute 1 N of the fees for an N author paper where I was a tertiary author and currently under funded ',2,LINK,NONE,0
'http___academia_stackexchange_com_questions_1118.html',14,'phd application','How do I deal with diverse interests when applying for a PhD program ','I have a master s degree in Computer Science I have applied to PhD programs and decisions are trickling in I may soon have to choose between two or more PhD programs Unfortunately I have diverse interests I was advised that a successful PhD application is usually quite specific so I made each of my applications very specific I wrote to a professor working in decision making AI another working in computational learning theory another working in computer music another working in quantum parallel computing another working in logical foundations philosophy of computation With much enthusiasm I informed each professor that I was interested in pursuing a PhD in his her field This is true I am interested in each of these fields and know something about each of them When advised to apply I did The problem is being interested in each of these fields also means that I m interested in all of them There are more areas of CS I m interested in What s worse my interests are not even restricted to CS For the purposes of this post I m restricting myself to only the mentioned areas So when I choose between PhD programs I m choosing between completely different areas and that is surely going to be excruciating This is not a case of not knowing my true interest now only to discover it later I have no true interest I have always pursued numerous unrelated things in parallel I love all my interests equally In fact I love the feeling of being interested more than the interests themselves Whenever I ve tried to restrict myself to one topic of study even for a month that feeling is lost and I am quickly bored As a result my skill set is a classic case of a jack of all trades master of none The worst part is everybody knows that a PhD is about getting deep into one specific topic It s not about breadth it s about depth Even if I were to choose one of the PhD programs and I must choose one I have a feeling that I might get bored quickly and be prone to constant topic changing transferring Again this is not about being fickle it s about following my heart and my heart takes me to different things at different times Do you think I m likely to fail never complete my PhD Does anyone have any advice about dealing with diverse interests Has anyone felt the same way and dealt with it I d love to hear from you ',' My experience with non American PhD programs is limited so some of what I say here may not be relevant or possible First I think you may have painted yourself into a corner More important than being specific PhD applications should be honest Hopefully your applications described the breadth of your interests perhaps with some extra emphasis and detail in one area rather than implying falsely that you are only interested in one topic It s better to be rejected than to be accepted into a PhD program where you won t thrive I think you need to look for overlaps and connections between your various fields of interest Decision theory and machine learning are not that far apart Quantum computing and philosophy of computing are not that far apart Parallel computing and logic are not that far apart Decision theory and logic are not that far apart Machine learning and computer music are not that far apart Finding something at the intersection of five or six different areas is almost certainly impossible but lots of interesting stuff happens at the interface between field X and field Y On the other hand all the areas you describe are incredibly diverse within their own boundaries You may find enough different topics within say machine learning to keep your fickle heart satisfied One thing you should ask about quickly is the possibility of having multiple ie two advisors in different areas Some departments encourage inter disciplinary co advising some don t Some advisors encourage collaboration with other faculty others flatly forbid it In many European PhD programs students are attached to specific projects of specific faculty from day one and moving between projects or fields is almost impossible What worries me more than the diversity of your interests is this sentence Whenever I ve tried to restrict myself to one topic of study even for a month that feeling is lost and I am quickly bored You have to get over that Research requires long term focused attention Early in your PhD program you may be able to juggle a couple of different research projects at once but eventually you have to focus on a coherent thesis topic It can be an interdisciplinary topic sure but it has be coherent You will have to work on that one topic for years If that sounds awful to you then maybe you don t want to be a PhD student after all My department head has changed fields several times in his career so I think his advice on this topic is worth repeating Assuming good health and good luck you have a 50 year research career ahead of you So if you re deeply interested in half a dozen different areas you can afford to spend seven or eight years on each one I d start with a fundamental question why do you want to get a Ph D It s a major commitment of time and effort so it s only worthwhile if you need a Ph D to accomplish your long term goals Getting a Ph D really isn t worth doing for its own sake or out of a feeling that it s something you ought to do because you like computer science or enjoy education or feel you should have the highest degree you can get Really it s just preparation for what you ll do after you graduate So from this perspective the question becomes what you hope to be doing in ten or fifteen years Not specific topics but rather what sort of career When you look around at faculty or industrial researchers do you see people who make you say Yes that s exactly the sort of work and the range of topics I d love If you do then you should look into these cases specifically You can study websites and CVs and maybe even e mail a few questions although keep in mind that people will be busy so don t be pushy and don t waste time with questions you can answer in other ways How did they end up in these positions that appeal to you If you can find many people doing what you d like to do then that s an excellent sign and you just have to learn how they did it If you can find only a few or even none then you should worry that maybe a Ph D isn t the right path for you In that case if you enter a Ph D program you ve got to hope for one of two things Either academia will change you or you will change academia Either is possible but neither is likely I don t mean for this to be discouraging but I strongly recommend thinking this through carefully before getting too far into a Ph D program if you haven t already Once you start quitting is difficult psychologically even when it s clearly the right decision It s easy to spend years in denial knowing things aren t really working out the way you had anticipated but hoping they ll somehow get better This isn t healthy so the more thinking you do in advance the better Good luck I hope you either find role models in this career path or find another that suits you better It is possible that you will have trouble finishing your dissertation and thus obtaining your PhD It is easy to do your coursework each subject takes only one semester You ll finish your subjects before you get bored But a dissertation usually takes a year or more to finish One possibility is to take your PhD at a university which allows publication of a few papers as equivalent to a dissertation You can make the papers about different fields and yet related to each other

'http___academia_stackexchange_com_questions_2498.html',28,'graduate school','Is transferring an option for an unhappy grad student ',' I hope this is on topic please delete if not If the answer varies by subject please mention the subject in your answer I ve heard of people transferring between graduate schools because of their advisor moving to another school and taking their students with them Do students ever transfer for other reasons If a student isn t happy at the school they choose could transferring be an option Presumably they would frame it as something positive such as turns out I really want to work with Professor X rather than I hate my school but does this ever happen Is there a certain timeframe in which this is possible Assume it s a 5 year PhD program Context many friends have told me that if it turns out I m not happy with my choice I can always transfer My impression is that this is actually difficult since many schools don t accept transfer students and in any case not being able to stick with a program looks bad but I don t have evidence either way so wanted to ask people who are in academia Of course the ideal would be to pick a school one is happy with in the first place ','Mathematics Let me specify that by transferring I mean moving to another university in the middle of a graduate program Switching universities between undergrad and grad or between a master s degree and a Ph D is very different Basically those are the only mainstream opportunities to move and anything else will require an exception Transferring is certainly not unheard of but there are some serious caveats It s difficult to transfer to a substantially more prestigious department It can happen but the admissions committee will be very skeptical and it s just not going to work out unless the application is outstanding In particular many committee members specifically do not want to reward rolling the dice again and seeing what happens so for transfers the question is not Does this application look better than our weaker students but rather Is this application so obviously wonderful that we would be shooting ourselves in the foot if we accepted someone else instead Expressing any unhappiness will make it much harder to transfer You may think you ll be happy at the new school but they will worry about ending up with an unhappy unproductive grad student on their hands And they are right to worry about that the best predictor of future happiness is past happiness and many unhappy people have unrealistic beliefs about what would make them happy It s hard to transfer once you start seriously working on a thesis If your work isn t going well then that s a reason not to accept you If your work is going well then that s a reason you should continue working with your current advisor Unless your advisor has died or left it will be tough to convince anyone you are a good candidate for transferring No matter why you say you want to transfer there will be some suspicion that your goal is to end up in a stronger department or a more desirable location If you have another reason you ll have to make a powerful argument for it I ve heard of people transferring between graduate schools because of their advisor moving to another school and taking their students with them Sometimes they transfer officially and sometimes they still get degrees from the previous school but complete their theses while in residence at the new school The latter is generally easy to arrange when an advisor moves Computer Science Yes PhD students transfer for many reasons besides moving advisors Sometimes the reasons are purely professional for instance I ve seen several students successfully transfer because they discovered a passion for a subfield that didn t match the interests experience of the local faculty Sometimes they re more personal things like two body problems especially when they become three body problems Sometimes advisors die or leave academia Sometimes it s because of an irreconcilable disagreement between student and advisor committee Sometimes the student just thinks they can do better than their current department and has the publications to prove it Probably the most painless time to transfer is immediately after completing a master s degree I did this That s a natural time to switch research directions and many PhD programs allow their students to pick up a Master s degree along the way even if they don t have a separate Master s program Mine didn t Still applications from MS students in PhD departments will face skepticism especially if the applicant already has a good track record with their former advisor Why do they want to leave their current advisor Shouldn t we offer this slot to someone who doesn t have one So it s important for the applicant s research statement to explain why the new department would a better match without disparaging the old department It s also important to have a strong and supportive recommendation letter from the former advisor to address possible concerns about technical weaknesses or personality conflicts And if a PhD applicant doesn t have a good track record with their MS advisor they re not likely to be admitted anyway Computer Science It s not uncommon for a student to transfer usually earlier in the program The reasons can be as you mentioned and often there are non academic reasons as well You do have to apply again from scratch although its possible that admissions committees will look more generously on the application You might be able to apply out of cycle for spring admission as well there are fewer applicants and each application gets more careful scrutiny But in any case it is important to have a reason relating to the desired destination If you want to work with professor X it will help immensely if professor X can speak on your behalf by writing a letter In other words don t think of transferring out but think about transferring in to maybe one or two targeted placed Field Mathematics Transferring is possible although you might have to start over at your new university For example perhaps you have completed the first year sequence of courses in University A and passed some prelims before transferring to University B At University B you might either be required to go through their first year sequence or take and pass the relevant prelims to have the courses waived This can be difficult since first year courses and topic and prelims tend to vary across departments In addition depending on how much prior experience you have before coming to University B they might require you to finish your degree in less than usual time say 3 4 years instead of 5 In particular folks with Masters degrees applying to PhD programs are often required to get a second Masters in their second university Source A friend of mine transferred from Rice Mathematics to UW Madison Mathematics additionally this was a topic of conversation at a Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics where a breakout session leader had transferred universities mid PhD ',5,NONE,LINK,6

make voip calls without a number Thanks ','It s not possible to have the same number on two different phones On your Nexus S you could install Skype That will give you FREE VOIP for Skype to Skype calls You don t need a number for this just an internet connection and a Skype account which is free Take note however Skype to mobile landline is not free For other alternatives search for voip in Google Play Edit 1 I looked around and found IPKall It gives you a FREE Washington number Is this the kind of service you are looking for Viber is a free call and messaging app Both parties should be

accounts the following situation happens You re based in the United States The pbxes org servers are in Germany and will ask permission to use your credentials to login to your Google accout via their

Transport type is TCP and that your Port number is 5060 You can probably use another port but it seems to work Oh wait port 5060 is the official SIP port Go to en wikipedia org wiki List of TCP and UDP port numbers and search 5060 SO YOU USE 5060 AND LIFE WILL BE GOOD Don t be smart and say I ll use port NO This is not a storm you are not a sailor going to another port You will use 5060 and you will be happy with the choice Alternatively port 5061 is SIP over TLS but I ve never used that and I am not sure if it would work 6 SAVE the account VI TESTING THE PHONE If you ve gotten this far without errors or crying then try calling a number 1 Dial your number From now on dial with the following format 1 areacode XXX YYYY That way you don t have to worry about whether or not it s a local

Company blog With subdomain blog mycompany com Integrated CMS for site content and also Blog E mail opt in for when a free trial of software is downloaded How should I explain what I need to designers that I interview How can I know that they will create a good SEO site As you can tell im not a tech guy P S Any idea on price We re a bootstrapped start up so there is a mediocre budget Any and all help would be appreciated Thanks ','Just a friendly tip You might get better answers if you post each individual problem as a question with the right tags instead of lumping putting multiple questions together under the same tags To your questions E commerce website with Shopping cart Think about whether you really need a shopping cart on site If you only have a few different products then maybe it s simpler to use one of the hosted value added payment handling sites Try to avoid handling legally protected credit card numbers yourself by using a 3rd party Company blog With subdomain blog mycompany com If you re using the same web technology for everything then www mycompany com blog is often a little better than blog mycompany com in terms of search engine performance There is no reason to set up 2 hostnames www blog if it s all hosted on the same single server Integrated CMS for site content and also Blog Self hosted Wordpress 3 is a strong candidate for this requirement E mail opt in for when a free trial of software is downloaded Often handled by a small HTML form that posts the result to a newsletter handling service like MailChimp or by storing this information together with the order and then manually adding the customer to a newsletter service How can I know that they will create a good SEO site You don t really but if you use a good blog CMS engine like Wordpress 3 then you get many best practices baked in for free You ll still have to do lots of work with link building and trust building but done with quality content and quality backlinks not on page tweaks Also see the previous posts about SEO here First you ll need to figure out in more detail what will be on your site What informational pages will you have e g About Us FAQ Contact Case Studies etc List it out and the more detailed the list the more accurate any quote will be as well as cheaper in most cases Second in terms of being well designed there is some risk that you cannot get rid of because you haven t seen the design they chose for your site But you can and should look at other sites the designer developer has built to get an idea for their style and only look further at companies that have a style you like Third SEO At the risk of starting a flame war this is one of the most difficult areas to assess While there are some basics that are easily verifiable much of what is done for SEO even by companies that are actually quite good at it are impossible to verify independently As a result the best way to go here is to start working with a company for which you can get a reference and watch for results For a slightly longer discussion on my opinions of the SEO industry you can read an article I wrote a while back here Last price It really depends where you go and how much of a custom design you re looking for A site such as the one you describe can cost from about 1000 to upwards of 10 000 for a fully customized look My guess is that you would probably be somewhere in the 2 000 to 4 000 range using a lightly modified template for your site If you are interested feel free to get in touch with me directly about your site for a more precise quote I do some site development and would be happy to look at your project ifyou want E commerce website with Shopping cart For Software that we will be selling via digital download As someone else mentioned if you are really strapped for cash consider a third party service for this If you have a little money doing it yourself provides greater integration with the rest of your web presence in terms of branding SEO etc and generally a better UX User eXperience Company blog With subdomain blog mycompany com Again reiterating another s point mycompany com blog is generally better SEO wise unless you have a good reason to break it off to its own subdomain Integrated CMS for site content and also Blog E mail opt in for when a free trial of software is downloaded I know that someone else recommended Wordpress I don t Wordpress is the best blog tool out there but it is just that a single purpose tool You aren t building a single aspect web presence i e just a blog Developing a blog on Wordpress with a third party service to handle your ecommerce email list and trial downloads will probably be a little cheaper up front but when you are ready to grow beyond that you will have to redevelop the entire site from scratch on another platform and migrate all your products and content It s a pain and depending on how well your third party service lets you get your data out if the WP site was done as well as possible etc may get expensive I recommend using a full featured general purpose CMS like Drupal 1 It s like getting an entire toolbox instead of a single purpose tool Not only can Drupal easily handle your main web site blog ecommerce mailings and everything else on your list including having great SEO tools but Drupal can do all the things you might want to do later but haven t thought of yet This means you will not have to go through the bother and expense of redeveloping your whole site on a new platform no matter what direction your web presence takes down the road and you can adapt with much more speed and less upheaval in general How should I explain what I need to designers that I interview How can I know that they will create a good SEO site As you can tell im not a tech guy A good developer look for someone who uses the title developer or consultant not designer which generally comes with a more limited skill set will walk you through creating a good site specification We don t expect every client to know all about web design if you knew everything we did we wouldn t have jobs It sounds like you have a decent feature list thought out so it won t be hard for an experienced consultant to get you where you need to be Based on your list I could do a 1 hour phone call with you after which we d not only have your development planned out but an idea of what directions the site might take after launch Any consultant who can t doesn t know what he she is doing A good consultant will also insist on training you as part of the deal As for choosing the right consultant Ask about their experience get client references and most importantly find out whether they are active in their professional community A good Drupal consultant gives code support documentation or other tangibles back to the Drupal community it s not all that altruistic doing so keeps us up to date with changes in our CMS or platform and lets us help nudge it in directions good for our business The same goes for a Wordpress consultant or someone using another open source platform Community contributions indicate skill speaking at or even better organizing and speaking at conferences indicates the respect of one s peers good client references indicate good customer service P S Any idea on price We re a bootstrapped start up so there is a mediocre budget Price is really hard to nail down without going through creating a specification with you Here are some general ideas to help you along though Under or around 1 000 you will probably need to go third party service for at least your ecommerce stuff If you make a few compromises license a non exclusive theme or make slight modifications to a good free theme instead of going custom for example you can probably do everything you listed on your own Drupal site for the neighborhood of 2 3k including training If you want a truly custom theme need logo design add things that require custom modules your current list

Regards CMAX','One thing you need to do is stop computing with percentages The only way to keep your numbers straight is to think strictly in terms of how many shares exist and how many you have period Of course it s great to compute percentages afterwards as a guide but if you try to use them to figure things out you ll just confuse yourself Finally understand that each change to the cap table happens serially That makes it easier to compute Show what the company looked like shares totals only before you arrived then modify exactly for you For example did they issue new shares for your investment or did someone give you some of his shares Once answered it s easy to put those numbers in a spreadsheet You have many questions here all good ones you might want to split them up into different questions on the site so you can get deeper answers to each I have not been in this situation and looks like a real mess Consider dropping startup 1 If you are prepared to drop startup 1 then you have negotiating power if you need that 20 an hour then your just consulting at that rate and view the loss as water under the bridge and lesson learned Always negotiate your terms upfront Always have an attorney review and make suggestions In general do not put money into something you re going to do the work in unless a substantial level of ownership in something you believe in is provided in an agreement Have everything in writing and make sure you have the info that shows who the officers are of the company Also whenever possible work with people you already know when being a founder so a level of trust exists up front Always have an attorney review the agreement prior to starting significant work When investing in a company normally new shares are issued from the company unless you are buying from the other owner So total value of equity invested in your above example is 122K and you are 2 122 ownership unless something else is negotiated for your investment Also don t do the agreement in email You can discuss terms and such to negotiate over email but final agreements should be in writing notarized US and reviewed prior by an attorney and sometimes also a CPA Difference between stock option and stock is that an option is an agreement to get a stock at a certain price while the stock itself describes an equity position in a company So stock is ownership while a stock option is the right to get ownership if exercised When issued from a company this gives you the right to buy stock of the agreed type at the agreed terms within the agreed time frame Sometimes you have the right to sell the stock option and someone else can exercise this At this stage though relatively valueless Overall in my mind you re doing some risky behavior with your money and time and should seek professional council from an accountant and attorney prior to any more of these commitments I suspect you ll make a great entrepreneur after you get a better understanding of how to rate risks and returns Best of luck As Jason pointed out you have two quite different questions here In the future create two different threads for each question since they re unrelated Startup 1 Currently no tentative contract agreement Compenation has been less than statisfying 20 hr flat contract rate since 2008 Originated all patent designs and ideas yet no co inventor No company stoct or employee stock options Q1 Looking for advice on how to approach employer to set up contract compentation increase and or stock incentives Need some type of motivation to continue 50 60 hrs wk contributions It s always best to approach these things from a position of strength If you can afford to not work for 6 months and can easily find a different job you ll go in there feelling much more comfortable than if you need the job to put food on your family s table My philosophy is that any contractor should ASAP put the equivalent of 6 months of living expenses in the bank Once you ve got this covered you talk to the employer explain your issues and walk away if they re not addressed Startup 2 Emails stating following agreement 3 inventors partners with different contributions Inventor

sounds like a mess and depending on the country these agreements might be invalid In the US for instance you can t take 2000 from someone who s not an accredited investor to invest in a startup It s also easy to create these kinds of agreements in ways that will create problems down the line What happens if a partner walks away isn t performing etc You say on one hand that there are 3 partners

'http___answers_onstartups_com_questions_16638.html',11,'funding nda','How do I get funding without spilling the beans on my idea ','I ve got an idea for a product and I want to get funding How do I go about looking for funding without telling too many people or the wrong person about my idea I don t want it to be stolen ','You could go for an NDA but the truth is that its unlikely to be stolen So I suggest go through the business planning process which is first to look for a market for the product or service your idea covers Validate it by asking potential customers that they would be willing to pay and get an idea of price Best case is get people to commit to ordering your product Now you have evidence that the idea is viable Then estimate the costs it will take to create the business So the truth is talking about the idea and selling it is normaly the best way to get funding Normally people steal an idea after its been proven to be viable not prior to that So worrying about it this early is normally off Of course you could just tell me your idea and then I ll tell you if you should or shouldn t have kept it to yourself If the idea is more than just a notion but something that you ve got a working model and clearly has profit that s when you begin to worry about it But let s say you were creating a search engine You can talk about what it is that your solving without going into the algorthims that solve it Your fear is a common mistake by new entrepreneurs Check out my detailed blog post on the topic http blog foundrs com 2009 03 11 the great startup idea that i cant reveal yet Forget about the NDA Start executing No one funds ideas If I invested 100 000 in your idea today what would you do Often the answer is hire a developer Ok so now try to find a co founder who believes in your idea Whatever you plan on using the money for you can always take one more step on your own As you start executing also start getting in touch with business angels It will take time but the sure way to fail is to not make progress and go from idea to prototype At this stage you should not be worry about having your idea being stolen because if you don t share with people you won t be able to get the founding team and the more people know the better chances you have in getting funding The best advice I can give you is about my own self I came up with a idea about few months ago So I wanted to make sure I can achieve what I have thought I did the following things to make sure I could launch my venture and be successful at it Understand your idea can be implement and there is demand for it in the market Do the full research about your industry that your idea will launch who already excist and what they offer and how you be differ from them Create Business Plan for your idea I can e mail you the sample Recruit the founding team The team should be the people you know and can truest to make your idea come true During recruiting team you must find SOUL MATE not referring to life partner You cannot achieve your goals objective milestone alone and you need someone as partner who you can fully truest and he she will help to make your mission and vision come true Once you get all that in place you need to find out should be in your business plan how much money you need for your startup Once you could figure that out you need to decide if you want to approach Venture Capital firms or Angel Investors for funding Very important you know the difference between these two because VC always want more share of the company but can offer great support and more funding in near future where AI are some who is successful entrepreneur Angel Co not com but co is the site where Angel Investors look at the pitch from startup entrepreneur and if they like your idea you will get the money funding But remember you are require to post your idea you don t have to give out all the detail but my personal advice to you is even if you cannot share your idea with anyone than you will have hard time truest anyone If you get the chance watch Social Network Facebook movie and you might think what the heck I am saying but if you are a entrepreneur than you should watch that movie Will give you many good tips Rest good luck with your venture and hope I could help to solve your problem But remember one thing and it will really help in long run you can come up with trillion dollar idea and it has huge market but it you who know how to implement that idea Without right implementation strategy your idea worth nothing but a penny Once you succeed in that process watch hundreds or even thousand new companies born from your idea but will not succeed because you master the Implementation Strategy that made your business successful Take care R John gave good advice Ideas are a dime a dozen it s all about implementation The best thing you can do for yourself is share your idea with as many people as possible and start validating that you have an idea worth investing in From my little experience in the VC world they aren t in the idea funding business but are looking for ideas with traction e g customers Good luck VC s have other ways of screwing you But if you are really worried about it dry to get as much done without taking money as you can Even if it is just wire frames The other route is a friends and family round I tend to agree with the board The word would quickly get out that a VC is stealing ideas Another thing you can do is find out what investments the VC already has in their portfolio If they have one that competes with you head to head they are likely not going to be interested unless you have a better mouse trap If you do then I would still pass on that VC because it will make it to your competitor We are going through that now with a series B round A VC has a business that loosely competes in their portfolio Ours is a relationship business that uses software to service our clients so we are not worried about it That said we track the other company hitting our site and our profiles and any public data they can about us Prior to our presentation we were not on their radar all a crap shoot I wouldn t sweat it They are buying the management team as much as the idea Lots of startups try doing stealth mode which frankly is a load of crap If you re doing something that CAN easily be replicated then you re either going to win on quality or speed and if it can t easily be replicated then you don t have much to worry about do you As John said don t give away the secret sauce but when investors hear the words NDA Proprietary or Trade secret they tend to run for the hills unless it s patented and or the company is already profitable You can patent an idea if the idea is new and if you could fully and clearly describe the idea in the context of the problem which you are trying to solve I see alot of posts on the internet telling people that VC are not interested in stealing ideas but this contradicts what VC do and how they actually make money We all know that VCs make money from financing ideas so the quality of ideas is critical to the success failure of VCs some VCs have close relations with governments that would help them steal ideas from inventors and aspiring entrepreneurs VCs DO want need good ideas so you must try your best to protect them before presenting them to people who you have never met The people who tell you that venture capitalists are not in the business of stealing ideas are spreading lies The truth is that venture capitalists ARE in the business of stealing ideas They can steal your ideas and then hire other people to implement them Most venture capitalist are unethical business people in my opinion Ideas are a dime a dozen it s all about implementation This is nonsense Implementation of what How would you know what to implement without first having great ideas This ideas is nothing implementation is everything is another myth that can trick you into thinking that ideas are not worth protecting through patents and copyright The first thing you should do is to patent your ideas Do NOT approach another business or venture capitalist for money if your ideas have not been properly protected ',9,NONE,LINK,4

'http___answers_onstartups_com_questions_20108.html',12,'promotion','How do I promote my soon to launch startup ','I m about to launch a new web startup in less than a month It ll be a freemium web application which will offer a Facebook related service with various pricing plans I m still a bit unsure on how to promote it at the start so any advice is well received What I thought so far is that I could release the first version as a private beta which requires an invitation code to sign up and maybe try to get some reviews from blogs The only ones which I came up with are Mashable and TechCrunch and while it would be great to get a review from one or both of them I know that it is very hard so if you know any other good place where I could get a review let me know too Anyway what else could I do Buy Google ads Or maybe Facebook ads since my product is Facebook related as I said any advice is well received thanks ','I think Jarie pretty much covered the main ideas But wanted to add some thoughts regarding blog outreach Mashable and TC are probably not the first publications that will write about you so you need to build up to that stage Since its a freemium model it works in your favor to send it out to bloggers that you think will use it Spend time to research targeted smaller bloggers that are very relevant to your app and would be interested in writing about it Work your way up If enough people like it you should build momentum that you will get picked up by other and bigger blogs I m not an expert but I m working through this very issue myself Here are some resources I ve found useful go through them if you haven t already I ve got a bunch more if you want to read They re a goldmine of information how to create a good blogger pitch preparing for launch thoughts on product launch promotion pitch to tech bloggers three keys to laying a strong pr foundation fab 5 product marketing blogs how to get your first 1000 users Oh and write on Onstartups You certainly can buy ads but that s only part of it What you need to do is create some buzz around that you are doing Building the proper buzz takes some planning but it s achievable if you build layers What that means is you have more than one promotion route or campaign Consider these additional things besides ads that can help you build buzz Have a well known blogger write a story about your site Start a company blog Start a fan page on Facebook Do a Twitter give away Approach a company that s in the space that will complement their offering and partner As you can image it takes some time to develop a network of people that like what you are doing and will promote it Even if you get on TechCrunch you still have to have the layers of other campains to keep the buzz going To promote your product you really need to think like your potential customer Who are they Where do they hang out What is the best approach to target them Every service no matter how broad should focus on a niche type of customer or vertical and just hammer it until some traction is met Typically when I launch a product I look for forums related to a niche the highly resonates with the product Then I just write a little blurb about the product be sure not to come off as spam in the forum and get some feedback This has been very effective for myself one product we launched had over 10 000 beta testers in one week When we launched we saw over 10 convert into paying customers Focusing on posts from general tech blogs like Techcrunch or Mashable will send you some traffic and some early adopters but in a weeks time you ll fade off the map unless you have some great viral capabilities built in Look for long term growth and not short term growth Getting listed on Mashable and Tech Crunch is very difficult for a founder who is relatively unknown in the tech startup industry A better option would be to craft an outstanding pitch including your story why you re starting your startup and what odds you ve had to overcome to get to where you are today and submit it to startup blogs and directories Bloggers will see your startup listed and consider writing about it Then as more bloggers pick up the story it could catch the interest of larger tech blogs You should also submit to startup communities like Launching Next which include thousands of subscribers looking to hear about promising young startups Hold off on promoting your startup through paid tactics Spending money on things like paid search or display banners as soon as you launch is a great way to burn through cash without knowing if your website landing page needs improvement first Instead recruit your first users organically social media blog posts friends adjust your website layout content and product offering price based on their responses and then look into paid promotions You ll find yourself in a much better position later on Most of the things which i have in my mind was in my previous post But most important thing is to generate curiosity about your application keep a landing page and also ask your twitter friends and other friends to give a tweet about it or ask them to send an invitations to your friends because mass email will not give a good desired results but man to man marketing will give initial customers which might be helpful in expansion of the customer base Not only tech crunch but if you ask any popular entrepreneur to give feedback in twitter it also helps you a lot ',6,NONE,LINK,16
'http___answers_onstartups_com_questions_20125.html',0,'pricing hosting cost','Figuring out margin on fixed costs','I m currently hashing out my price points for a hosting service that I plan on launching on Amazon AWS The biggest line item in the budget is currently the machine time I know that if I give a user x GB of transfer it costs me x cents and the same with storage space How do I calculate how much that customer costs me as part of the server hardware overhead ','To be honest some figures are needed for me at least or some idea of if the machine time is really a fixed cost or if it will vary based on the number and size of the user accounts I think more pertinent is what do your competitors charge and how can you be competitive ie rapid deployment for RoR like Heroku But Mathematically from scratch for readability to all in the case others may search this with no previous knowledge in the future profit total revenue TR total costs TC TR price P x quantity Q total variable costs TVC VC Q TC fixed costs FC VC Q From your question you are stating that the machine time server hardware is a FC Also you have to assume that the FC is variable in the long run and dependant on the VC Q Assuming that VC 1 ie 1GB of transfer and storage per customer You will then just need to find the capacity that each FC one hardware can sustain and divide through using VC and then multiply by Q ie FC is 100 and VC is 1 multiplied by 100 the capacity that the FC can bare then FC VC 100 100 1 then FC VC Q 1 Q your TC I realise that this answer is ridiculously simplified but based on the info provided i would be amazed if anyone could provide you with a better one Anyway I hope that this helps If you provide further info i will add more to the answer tomorrow It depends on how much you want to subsidize your new customers with the hope that once future customers arrive you will make money You need to spread machine costs across all of your customers So when customer 1 arrives you cannot charge the entire cost of a system to them You will need to figure out how many customers it will take to reach your break even point for machine costs Divide fixed machine costs by that number to price it for your initial customer So you may sell the first one but if you never get to the expected break even number of customers you do not make any money on machine fixed costs It s a fair and simple question There isn t a simple answer Suppose you have a fixed cost of 1 000 You are confident that this will service up to 250 customers and you have built a business case with an expectation of selling to 50 150 customers What is the correct cost allocation per customer Maybe it s 20 That sets a conservative expectation the 1 000 is spread across the low case 50 customers Maybe it s 10 That s the midpoint expectation 1 000 spread across the central view of 100 customers Maybe it s 4 That s 1 000 divided by the 250 customers the infrastructure could actually support And maybe it s 0 That s recognising that in the general case a new customer is not generating new cost All these based on that very basic sketch are valid but that range under states real life complexities For instance what happens as you approach 250 customers Maybe there s another 1 000 cost slug coming your way Or maybe there are economies of scale and the next chunk of cost will be 500 Or maybe there are dis economies and you ll have to spend 1 500 Each of those calculations needs revising and there are some more methodologies that you could use to address that semi fixed character But then step back If your expectation were 20 customers not 100 would you have done things differently could you have chosen a fixed cost of 500 in this case or even avoided fixed costs altogether Often So where does that leave those numbers Before you despair life becomes rather simpler when instead of talking about cost you qualify by saying for instance cost from the perspective of the pricing decision And I suspect this is the type of cost you may be concerned about Then you should be looking first and foremost at the marginal cost which is probably the lowest of all the figures you can work out You should have alarm bells ringing if your pricing goes below this cost and either eliminate these cases by price and proposition design or build in risk management if for instance this arises from patterns of use you can t know in advance Then your pricing process will be I would hope pricing based on opportunity which will be based on views including Your chosen target market Current competitor offerings Typical competitor cost bases in this case you d probably look at hosting companies running their own systems and at main white label offerings offered for resale Value of distinctive features for instance if the way you ve built your offering allows you to offer higher uptime stronger backup better performance etc etc than market norms As a final note to anyone who s horrified by the thought that the cost floor might essentially ignore fixed costs consider the following A competitor with access to the same infrastructure and AWS isn t a secret will have similar economics Other cost allocation approaches may feel prudent but they may bake in a wholly artificial cost disadvantage that closes off potential markets to no benefit Even in highly competitive markets there s a constant disincentive to charge at cost so that the apparent comfort in over stating floor cost is unnecessary In initial business cases it s very common for variable costs to be overstated in this case does a customer taking a 20GB data transfer package actually use the 20GB that was put in as a cost and even in cases where sophisticated cost driver analysis has been carried out it is generally the case that there s an inherent benefit in achieving some level of scale which is one reason why new entrants will often use aggressive price offers In this area of hosting many of the underlying costs are on reliable downward trajectories so that it s probable that each time cost is reviewed the new cost calculation will produce similar or lower costs An aggressive and efficient competitor reviewing the same landscape may even choose to take this into account and discount expected actual costs to take into account customer lifetime factors ',4,NONE,NONE,0

employees if you were working on an internet startup alone I really wonder if there are experienced people which started their startup alone and expand it Here are the questions that i am willing to ask 1 How do you find them it is really problem for a new startup to find talented people Why they would choose them since they are working on other companies Other than salary i mean Do you recommend to post to career websites or use social media 2 Even you have found them since you are not an enterprise how do you keep the communication with your first employees 3 If you hire a friend of yours to your company would you get any problems with that Also what are the tactical ways to convience your friend to work for you Or you think that each startup to be successful should be founded by at least 2 3 partners ','There s no one right way but the first hires are really important to your growth and success Choose carefully and find people who buy into your vision and the long term opportunity Here s my experience My first employee was my son who was looking to move back to town a couple of years after after college It was a great transition for him and a huge help for me not to mention the benefits of getting reacquainted after his living in another part of the state for the prior 6 years The company doubled the 15 months he was with me giving me the courage to replace him immediately when he transitioned to a company in his career field My second hire was someone I d knew well and saw regularly He was really smart highly ethical detail oriented and tired of the travel required by his current company I couldn t initially match his current salary but the opportunity worked for us both so he accepted my offer Many years later we still work together really well he s become a great friend and an important part of the company s success You want to hire someone who has drank the Kool Aid You will want to look for people who are not risk averse Those who see benefits in building something from the ground up That is part of their reward They thrive in an environment where risk is part of the game They may have a little entrepreneur in them also but never could take the leap all on their own If you hire people like that you will feed off of each other If you hire properly your company truly becomes greater than a sum of its parts When you interview pay attention to the questions they ask Let them speak and ask the questions You will learn more in the interview process if you let them drive it You can learn much more about who a person is from the questions they ask than any answer they will ever give If you ask the questions they will tell you what they think you want to hear True character comes out in questions Not to mention the fact that if you are founding a startup you think your product or service is the greatest thing that ever existed You should or you will never succeed But part of that is if you do the talking you will spend all the time trying to sell them on working for you and you will never find out if they should If at anytime they ask questions about vacation time PTO working hours insurance or benefits it is quite likely they are not the type of person that a startup needs If they ask about stock options profit sharing or IPO s you might have a winner I also would advise you to hire slowly and fire quickly With a few exceptions I will freely admit that every person I have ever fired was someone that I should have never hired in the first place It was my fault not theirs They can be the most skilled person in the world but if they do not fit with your vision dreams goals and culture they will be a boat anchor you will have to cut loose You cannot afford that right now Find good people doing a good job in another related field and poach them with your awesome start up idea your execution plan and your enthusiasm People are motivated either extrinsically or intrinsically Intrinsic motivation is a much stronger force for

'http___answers_onstartups_com_questions_2722.html',3,'ideas','Thinking about creating small desktop games who is this market ','I m thinking about starting to build and publish small desktop games and puzzles My background is 10 years of server c java programming No GUI experience and no gaming experience I just love games How hard is this market Can anyone give me real life insights of this desktop indie small games mIsv industry ','As with any new endeavor you first want to get an idea as to the target market For instance how much now do you play these type of casual games For an example of one revenue stream look at http games yahoo com downloads But again it depends on who is in your target market This will be of more interest to 30 yr olds most likely For the younger market you are looking at IPhone and Android but neither are really using C and games that run on their social networking sites If you can make a chess game over Twitter for example two can play and others can monitor the game and that may be of interest but how would you possibly make any money off of it Any of these will require you to learn new platforms and languages and get into GUI work unless you stuck to Twitter games So for you the barrier to entry is high due to your lack of experience in this area if you have someone that has considerable java experience for example then you may be able to do something moderately quickly on Android if that person also knows OpenGL the 3D graphics for Android It is doable how much work how profitable depends on the details of your ideas and the implementation You may be able to get some work by writing some casual games for people to use on a business website for example Dress up your child at GapKids This would get you experience in doing casual games and perhaps be a source of revenue It s a tough tough market to make PC games but it also has a vibrant indie game community In contrast to the other answers here I d argue that desktop based games can be easier to start with than with mobile devices because the barriers to entry are lower If you develop for a mobile platform the makers of the device act as gatekeepers You ll often need to purchase their developer tools and framework You ll need to submit your product for their content and quality review Developing a flash based game might be a good compromise but it presents challenges of its own I highly recommend reading Lost Garden a great blog about indie gaming with a focus on Flash If you re not plugged in to the indie PC community I recommend going to GameTunnel and checking out some of the games and developers featured there Many indie developers have blogs or articles that highlight aspects of developing games and the business of gaming I would say desktop is a bad market for this unless you are doing flash games I would encourage you to look at doing this for mobile audiences and on hand held platforms like the PSP and DS To expand on this there are really a number of reasons I suggest this Most mobile hand held gaming systems have a distribution channel that all of their customers are funneled into This means potentially large amounts of customers having a chance to see and purchase your game While you still need to do marketing in most cases often these channels also feature rankings that if your able to climb will usually result in high sell volumes and being picked up by outside press and review sites easily This can lead to your product becoming self sustaining simply from holding a high rank and no other marketing campaign happening Developing for a fixed platform such as a game console or Iphone is much easier to do than developing for the PC sea in some ways There maybe more technical debt that needs to be payed in order to be able to successfully develop for them but the strength is that you have a single hardware configuration With PC you have thousands of different hardware configurations graphic cards etc This can becomes a huge compatibility and support nightmare quickly This is why there are hardware compatibility labs and testing services that run successful businesses around this service as you really need to test on a huge range of hardware You also need to worry about frame rates and system requirements With a console you don t have any of this you code it to work on a given console and it works the same way across all of them Note that this is also true for the at large mobile cell phone market and some others like Android you end up needing in this case to test on tons of different devices that also have different hardware configurations and limits This is why I really recommend Iphone Flash Hand held game consoles PSP DS GBA Desktop sounds so 90s Just kidding but desktop is hard There is too much friction for the average user find online download install etc It s like 93 easier to open a flash game in the browser and 85 of users can do it totally made up numbers Then there is the piracy finally a user installs your game but you don t get any money off it 2D Boy the makers of the superb World of Goo reported 90 privacy for the pc version of the game This article on their blog discusses that There wasn t any DRM but still 90 is too much I d advice you go for mobile social or consoles The iPhone is big but kind of hard to get noticed like any market There is good opportunity in flash especially in the social networks Facebook is huge see Zynga Playdom Playfish and Twitter based games might be just taking off I don t really think there is much value in twitter games myself Plus you don t really need that fancy graphics you still need good looking graphics though I m not really sure how consoles are doing but the Wii Ware and Xbox Arcade look fine Oh and a great graphics designer is a must I d say just focus on making one game and keep improving it over the time and simultaneously launch it over as many platforms as possible Multi player games and especially building a community around it works out quite well Anyway I suggest that you should first pick up a game development book and learn more about the art and science of game development Take a look at the YoYoGames com game maker Creating a game is super easy then you can create desktop executables AND web versions of your game Plus a 25 license for the full version of the game maker can t beat that Just try to play a few of the games their users have made very impressive stuff Personally I d try iPhone as starter It s easier to develop artist wise and coding wise people understand the limitations and won t expect a Halo 3 Selling is easier payment etc all will be taken care for you easily No piracy People don t want to spend 5 over the web but most of the iPhone users are used spend money on iTunes Also XBox Live and PSN got similar feature but they expect a very high quality and polished games Since this will be your first game development experience you might not get there right away Not to totally disagree with fm while the Iphone is a great development platform and I completely recommend it there is piracy Actually most iphone games apps have a 50 90 piracy rate and are usually pirated within a hour of being released There are automatic tools that break the DRM strip a few things and upload them to torrents Sorry about the additional answer but I currently lack the reputation to comment I have been a Palm game developer and had success selling casual games Here is the outline if I were to start again Build a browser based HTML5 game using javascript and the canvas tag Don t go for fancy games just basic puzzles to begin with The benefit of this approach is that now you can use phonegap like tools to package it for Android and iphone It also works on desktop and you can host a free version on your site ',10,NONE,LINK,0

'http___answers_onstartups_com_questions_27567.html',3,'co founder','Advice on having my friend as a co founder for this startup','I have a friend that lives in another country and wants to join my startup working part time outside his day job He said he ll work on weekends mostly I ve started it about 1 year ago working on it full time and now I ve got a version but it s not simplified enough and it s too complex to use The issue is that I have no idea if he will be committed to it or if he just wants to learn the technologies used I don t want to spend a lot of time which is very limited at this point for walking him through the project explaining the details and all that stuff and at some point to see that he was just interested to learn from my experience instead of having true hope in the success of the project I tried to face this problem and tell him directly that I don t want to loose a lot of time without knowing that he is really enthusiastic and really interested in it He told me that he likes the idea and thinks it could be better than the competitor s product but I really don t know if he is genuine about it For a long time now he says he wants access to the sources of the project and all other information I have about it but I hesitated to give until now because I don t want him to get involved in the technical part without being commited to the project first I d have to use a lot of time to explain the technology used what the code does etc I didn t feel until now although I might be VERY wrong about all these unjustified fears that he wants to simplify the idea since he kept asking for the sources first instead of analyzing the functionality and think of ways to improve the user experience At this point I really don t know what to do Is a long distance over skype collaboration possible on a web startup How can I know if he is genuine or not about the project How can I feel OK about all this I trust him as a friend and I know him for a lot of time and while we understood eachother very well all the time I think he was a bit superficial when it came to commitment And I don t blame him the things we did then weren t real projects and we did those out of pleasure Now it s a completely different story but I can t help to not think about how it was back then I d wish very much he d join me on this venture because I feel he could make a great difference to the project because he is a very smart guy I m also very worried that this lack of trust from my side might affect our friendship and I really don t want that to happen I d prefer to continue alone than to loose a friend ','At this point I really don t know what to do Is a long distance over skype collaboration possible on a web startup Yes it s possible to collaborate over Skype It s all about the right people right relationships Communication takes a little bit more work this way as long as both of you have very open communication it s possible That said it s a bit harder teaching someone over Skype If you need to teach him the technologies and the product what makes him a candidate to be a cofounder How can I know if he is genuine or not about the project How can I feel OK about all this If you have all of these doubts that should raise a red flag Break out some chunks of the project for him to work on and see how it goes For example if there is code that could be useful as it s own library or a plugin etc Maybe I ll hire a potential employee as a consultant to build it as a test project for him to see how he fits If he s good we can go from there if he s not it was only on a contract basis It doesn t sound like he has any reason to be committed to this project and I m not seeing the qualities that would make him a potential cofounder Are you planning to give him equity If so how much Would he accept being hired hourly and then maybe he gets a percent equity vested over time if it works out It s definitely a tough circumstance especially because he will not be putting in the same amount of time and effort as you The problem is not the distance although it doesn t help From the tone in your question I am sensing that you don t really trust this friend If I was talking to a true friend I wouldn t be concerned about him stealing my code for instance or trying to abuse me So I ll take a guess and assume that this is not a close friend but more like someone you kind of know but not very well A friend of a friend maybe Based on all the implicit negative tones in your question the short answer would be drop the friend it won t work If you think I am being too harsh then here is the test I would use to decide has the other person contributed lots of ideas for features and changes That s how I know if someone really believes in the product If all this friend has done is ask you to bring him on board but hasn t been bugging you actively about what if we did this what if we did that then drop him trust is the most important thing especially when it comes to virtual if i were you i will see how he develop the project and if he willing to show all the code to us and upload it to my server and if he willing to hear my opinion and do the project as i want to if he is i will trust him since it is a company make everything paper clear and i am sure you will be save remember there are a lot of great developer outside if he leave
