DELETION 1523:  I guess what I am asking is that if
ADDITION 1523: Edit:
DELETION 1524:  end target is
ADDITION 1524:  question:  Why would converting a 24-bit recording to
DELETION 1525:  bit, what is
ADDITION 1525: -bit introduce audible artifacts and distortion that wouldn't be present if
DELETION 1526:  audio quality downside in
ADDITION 1526:  original
DELETION 1527:  24 bit from
ADDITION 1527:  were done in 16-bit in
DELETION 1528:  start
ADDITION 1528:  first place
DELETION 1529:  You can't just "round" from 24
ADDITION 1529:  Think about what happens when rounding a number between 0 and 1: The information is either "included" (as a 1) or "removed" (set
DELETION 1530:  16 bits
ADDITION 1530:  0)
DELETION 1531:   How would you "round" the largest value
ADDITION 1531:   I.e., everything below 0.5 is "ignored" and everything greater than or equal to 0.5 is "enhanced"
DELETION 1532: 2^24 -
ADDITION 1532: increased to
DELETION 1533: ?  To the largest value in
ADDITION 1533: .  This is basically what happens to audio without dithering when converting from 24-bit to
DELETION 1534:  1?  That's off by
ADDITION 1534: bit.  Some information is completely removed, and some is altered, resulting in missing sounds and artifacts.  Dithering adds
DELETION 1535:  factor
ADDITION 1535:  random number to each value, meaning that some
DELETION 1536:  256
ADDITION 1536:  the values that would have been rounded down are now rounded up, and some values that would be rounded up are rounded down
DELETION 1537:   Not exactly acceptable error

DELETION 1578: LPC works by digitising the analog signal and splitting it into segments. For each of the segments we determine the key features of the signal and try to encode these as accurately as possible. The key features are the pitch of the signal (i.e. the basic formant frequency), the loudness of the signal and whether the sound is voiced or unvoiced. Parameters called vocal tract excitation parameters are also determined which are used in the vocal tract model to better model the state of the vocal tract which generated the sound. This data is passed over the network and decoded at the receiver. The pitch of the signal is used as input to either a voiced or unvoiced synthesiser, and the loudness data is used to boost the amplitude of this resulting signal. Finally the vocal cord model filters this sound by applying the LPC coefficients which were sent over the network.

ADDITION 2067:  To clarify the old "played" phrasing (which some people confuse with resolve), the
DELETION 2068:  - In Limited, your "sideboard" consists of all the cards from your pool that you didn't put in your deck, plus an unlimited supply of basic lands, should you need them. - You don't have to make 1-for-1 substitutions when sideboarding. So, for instance, if I don't like how my deck runs 17/40 lands but fear 18/40 would be excessive, I can "side in" a land without removing anything to go up to 18/41 lands. The only restriction is that your final deck still has to be legal (i.e. no less than 40 cards). - You don't have to "restore" your deck to any particular starting configuration for game 1 of each match. So there's no need to remember your starting configuration or undo a sideboard choice if you realized that it just runs better than your original 40-card list.

When using agar agar to make candy or firmer gel bases, it is not recommended to use fruit juice since it contains acids wich makes the agar unable to set properly. If you want to make turkish delights with agar, I believe you better use flavoring and coloring... I would even say you should use these in any recipe wich involves agar agar,unless otherwise specified. You

ADDITION 6055:  The first thing you need to do is divide up your search area. For this explanation the map is a square grid of tiles, because most 2D games use a grid of tiles and because that's simple to visualize. Note however that the search area can be broken up in any way you want: a hex grid perhaps, or even arbitrary shapes like Risk. The various map positions are referred to as "nodes" and this algorithm will work any time you have a bunch of nodes to traverse and have defined connections between the nodes.

DELETION 6141:  I don't know how you handle your components

ADDITION 6142:  might want to build a component
DELETION 6143:  you can maintain

DELETION 6144: ), then let the GameStateSystem determine the state of the game

DELETION 6145:  and pass the event

DELETION 6146:  the active Component.  Your component then receives the event, and does whatever it should with the input
ADDITION 6146:  react to
DELETION 6147:  I will say this, however:
ADDITION 6147:  It seems management systems such as

Where did shepards squadmates go and why are they on the normandy flying away from the battle?  Sgt Cortes (or whatever he is called) clearly states no one made it to the beam, yet how did he not see shepard and anderson go through? While talking with the boy (catalyst) you can still hear gunfire how when your the only thing alive on the citadel? The boy must be the reapers way to control shepards emotions and try to get him to control or synthesise the galaxy so that the reapers are still alive and kicking.

He was (and still has been) an outspoken supporter of both the United States and Israel, and was (and probably still has been) told repeatedly by those in the government that if he would simply stop speaking out in support of Israel, he would be given the full backing of the Iraqi leadership. Instead, he continued to speak out on Israel's behalf, and was stripped of his security detail, threatened with death, and lost his two sons in a bomb attack meant to kill him.

DELETION 8437:  Now as
ADDITION 8437:  Indeed, while visiting a website to research information for a question posted on JL&L, I came across a learning-oriented website which automatically redirected me to a "sorry, we're closed for Shabbos page" --- except it was not Shabbos yet
DELETION 8438:  technical implementation: You can't just go blocking your

DELETION 8439:  random hours because you'll end up shutting out legitimate

ADDITION 8441:  mind
DELETION 8442:  who can get really upset
ADDITION 8442:  it's hard to give a one-size fits all approach
DELETION 8443:  So what you
ADDITION 8443:  Essentially there are three problems:
DELETION 8444:  want
ADDITION 8444:  be to do the redirect server-side. So the first thing we can try
DELETION 8445:  use
ADDITION 8445:  get the users location for the timezone by using
DELETION 8446:  Geolocation
ADDITION 8446:  Geo-location: Except...
DELETION 8447:  find their approximate location
ADDITION 8447:  work right many times
DELETION 8448:  calculate the zmanim
ADDITION 8448:  but that only holds true if an IP always reflects a user's location. Which it doesn't
DELETION 8449: sunrise/sunset
ADDITION 8449: proxy server, dial-up, bad info, etc.
DELETION 8450:  for that latitude/longitude
ADDITION 8450: .
DELETION 8451:  then put
ADDITION 8451:  it told me I was in Massachusetts. Sorry, but
DELETION 8452:  little logic into your home page
ADDITION 8452:  simple reading of 
DELETION 8453: However
ADDITION 8453: (again, less elegant), we can 
DELETION 8454:  can
ADDITION 8454:  was accurate we could get it from there. A possible solution to this problem is to
DELETION 8455:  inaccurate in many cases
ADDITION 8455:  lenient. In other words
DELETION 8456:  especially where
ADDITION 8456:  in a given timezone (which we know
DELETION 8457:  using a proxy
ADDITION 8457:  in)
DELETION 8458:  or
ADDITION 8458:  what's the latest possible sunset? If the user's time
DELETION 8459:  dialing into a far away location
ADDITION 8459:  past that, then redirect, otherwise keep him here
DELETION 8460:  So
ADDITION 8460:  Finally, as for problem #3:
DELETION 8461:  may still want to keep it to a warning page
ADDITION 8461:  can actually output the server's GMT time [I would sincerely hope it's accurate!] directly into the Javascript code
DELETION 8462:  give

The Rav Ovadia would say that it is not only not casher for kidush but we say sheacol to drink. Because of this, today many wineries print that their wine/juice is also casher for havdala and kidush as the opinion of the maran habet iosef

Grammaticality, as one linguist explained it to me, means "following the rules of the relevant scientific model that is used to describe how people speak". So it is strictly dependent on the model used, but in practice many linguists presume that there is consensus about most elements of the relevant model, so it mostly overlaps with "people actually use this within a certain group and they consider it normal". 
ADDITION 8617: :
DELETION 8618:  The word "incorrect" may suggest that there is something wrong with straying from grammatically; I suspect that linguists do not use this much because they resent the implication. So I think that's why you will mostly see ungrammatical.

ADDITION 9480:  current score as the total score, but let us only consider cases with all
DELETION 9481:  used
ADDITION 9481:  consecutive
DELETION 9482:  it is pretty clear that all fours
ADDITION 9482:  and since
DELETION 9483:  must begin with
ADDITION 9483:  are 13 cards long,
DELETION 9484:  
ADDITION 9484:  Since there are only four stack, each value must appear exactly once per stack.
DELETION 9485:  and we must asign "colors" in order to maximize
ADDITION 9485:  based on
DELETION 9486:  sum
ADDITION 9486:  color
DELETION 9487:  absolute  values of

DELETION 9488:  stacks
ADDITION 9488:  stack, for example)
DELETION 9489:  It should be clear
ADDITION 9489:  As it has been pointed out, the stacks need not start with the same value; however, the first values of each stack are not all
DELETION 9490:  cards
ADDITION 9490:  independent:
DELETION 9491:  go on
ADDITION 9491: : say
DELETION 9492:  and $-$ stacks cannot go on the $\times$ and $\div$ stacks
ADDITION 9492:  stack starts with value $k$
DELETION 9493:  and vice-versa 
ADDITION 9493:  then it ends with value $
DELETION 9494: for parity reasons
ADDITION 9494: k \mod 13
DELETION 9495:  So what we really have is two sets
ADDITION 9495:  This means that one
DELETION 9496:  two stacks
ADDITION 9496:  both card with value $k$ and opposite color is missing a predecessor
DELETION 9497:  each

ADDITION 9500:  So
DELETION 9501:  (defined as the sum of the two absolute

DELETION 9502: ), it suffices to check all $2^{12}$ possibilities. Indeed, at each step, we know what value must be used, and there are only

DELETION 9590:  a leak that allows rain water to collect in the car. Check to see if the rugs are damp,look in the storage well behind the seat and any place water might collect. Do you also notice a sweet smell when the engine gets warm? If you do it may be a leaking heater core. Antifreeze could be leaking into the heater box then the vapor is fogging the windshield. Antifreeze residue can be difficult to remove from the windsshield. Try rubbing a clean tissue on the inside of the glass. The tissue may show the oily component of the antifreeze.It may be a small leak as a little antifreeze goes along way in terms of fogging the glass. The third source could be the A/C. The A/C unit removes humidity from the air. This is what causes the puddle under the car when the A/C is running. Sometimes the drain get clogged with leaves or pine needles. This allows the water to build up which adds humidity when you run the defroster. If enough has collected you may hear it sloshing under the dash when you make a turn.

It could seem as though we need to follow a rule to follow a rule (an infinite regression). That is, there would be a certain rule for applying rules by some similarity of circumstances; of course, it gets somewhat tricky for something like mathematics--where we often change the elements of the system to build foundations (e.g. the change in the concept of number that Dedekind and Canton brought about), and thus, are still expected to follow certain rules in new (but perhaps analogous) circumstances. (To identify situational analogs seems to be another sort of rule following.) The point is that it seems our minds "fill in the blanks," so to speak, of what is unknown by what we know. But it's also unclear why there is certainty when we apply a rule to new sets of problems.

The real culprit being unknown, the judge sees himself as able to prevent the bloodshed only by framing some innocent person and having him executed. Beside this example is placed another in which a pilot whose aeroplane is about to crash is deciding whether to steer from a more to a less inhabited area. To make the parallel as close as possible it may rather be supposed that he is the driver of a runaway tram which he can only steer from one narrow track on to another; five men are working on one track and one man on the other; anyone on the track he enters is bound to be killed. In the case of the riots the mob have five hostages, so that in both the exchange is supposed to be one man's life for the lives of five."

ADDITION 11320:  major rewrite of my previous answer, so if you've read it before you might like to read it again. I'll begin with a definition: "to create" - Bring (something) into existence. (dictionary.reference.com/browse/create). 
DELETION 11321:  To act or otherwise have an effect, one must in some sense
ADDITION 11321:  The question of what it means to
DELETION 11322:  must first exist, and be in existence,
ADDITION 11322:  that has been covered
DELETION 11323:  time of creation
ADDITION 11323:  existentialists
DELETION 11324:  At least the creator must be in existence at
ADDITION 11324:  A pre-cursor to
DELETION 11325:  time
ADDITION 11325:  existentialists, Martin Heidegger investigated
DELETION 11326:  the chain
ADDITION 11326:  bit
DELETION 11327:  events leading
ADDITION 11327:  reality which has the power
DELETION 11328:  creation was initiated. It is impossible for one
ADDITION 11328:  ask "what it means
DELETION 11329:  act or have
ADDITION 11329:  exist", ie Human Beings. (Heidegger proposes this philosophical investigation in 
DELETION 11330:  effect if one does

DELETION 11331:  exist
ADDITION 11331:  existence per se
DELETION 11332:  To be created is
ADDITION 11332:  I hope that I can take another approach
DELETION 11333:  come into existence. To transition from not-being
ADDITION 11333:  begin
DELETION 11334:  being
ADDITION 11334:  answer this question

DELETION 11337:  say
ADDITION 11337:  propose
DELETION 11338:  as if one existed and simply had
ADDITION 11338:  based on
DELETION 11339:  quality
ADDITION 11339:  definition
DELETION 11340:  not-existing. That would
ADDITION 11340:  "to create" given above, "to

ADDITION 11344:  did not exist". If in fact to create is to bring into existence, before one is created one has not been brought into existence. Therefore an uncreated
DELETION 11345:  The question pertains
ADDITION 11345:  With some agreement on what it means
DELETION 11346:  universe
ADDITION 11346:  thing in question
DELETION 11347:  but what
ADDITION 11347:  the universe. What
DELETION 11348:  that? The
ADDITION 11348:  the
DELETION 11349:  is space and time
ADDITION 11349: ? There are many competing definitions available
DELETION 11350:  Space being filled with physical matter and
ADDITION 11350:  For
DELETION 11351:  forces
ADDITION 11351:  purpose of this discussion I would like to appeal to scientific defintions. 
DELETION 11352:  laws that govern that matter
ADDITION 11352:  continue to be contested
DELETION 11353:  One might also call
ADDITION 11353:  At
DELETION 11354:  physical or natural universe
ADDITION 11354:  theory offered by Einstein's theory of general relativity and the theories offered by quantum mechanics. I'll consider each briefly
DELETION 11355:  Space
ADDITION 11355:  "Relativity says space
DELETION 11356:  intimately connected
ADDITION 11356:  on equal footing - together they are the fabric of reality" (
DELETION 11357:  Matter does not exist outside
ADDITION 11357:  The article this appears in goes on to describe that space and time are part of a single four dimensional fabric that can be modelled mathematically in ways that are very useful for predicting the behaviour
DELETION 11358:  and
ADDITION 11358:  nor can
DELETION 11359:  matter
ADDITION 11359:  space
DELETION 11360:  Since, in the creation of the universe we have an event in which both of these things are being created simultaneously
ADDITION 11360:  Both include each other. If
DELETION 11361:  that
ADDITION 11361:  consists of this fabric, I would argue that self-creation
DELETION 11362:  created at any other point than
ADDITION 11362:  not possible. The reason for that is that on this model
DELETION 11363:  beginning
ADDITION 11363:  laws
DELETION 11364:  time
ADDITION 11364:  existentialists, Martin Heidegger investigated
DELETION 11365:  Whatever
ADDITION 11365:  Effect follows cause. The effect of being
DELETION 11366:  the universe, did so outside
ADDITION 11366:  must follow its cause
DELETION 11367:  time, prior
ADDITION 11367:  creation. 
DELETION 11368:  beginning
ADDITION 11368:  laws
DELETION 11369:  time (though here "prior" must
ADDITION 11369:  the question. Is it necessary to exist in order to create? Or more broadly is it necessary to exist in order to act or
DELETION 11370:  unusual meaning)
ADDITION 11370:  effect
DELETION 11371:  But we know that
ADDITION 11371:  I believe
DELETION 11372:  universe consists of time and space
ADDITION 11372:  answer to this is obvious
DELETION 11373:  where
ADDITION 11373:  so I will proceed without the support of refernces for this point. Let us say, at least for
DELETION 11374:  is there is time and space
ADDITION 11374:  must exist in the instant prior to creation in order to create
DELETION 11375:  So
ADDITION 11375:  While
DELETION 11376:  cannot both
ADDITION 11376: , to
DELETION 11377:  time and space and create itself before time
ADDITION 11377:  created
DELETION 11378:  as it would
ADDITION 11378:  must
DELETION 11379:  be itself at
ADDITION 11379:  exist in the instant prior to creation in order
DELETION 11380:  would
ADDITION 11380:  may
DELETION 11381:  something else
ADDITION 11381:  created
DELETION 11382:  To answer briefly the question of whether
ADDITION 11382:  This presents two opposing requirements that cannot be reconciled in
DELETION 11383:  universe can create itself: no
ADDITION 11383:  one thing
DELETION 11384:  time forbids it
ADDITION 11384:  the creator must exist
DELETION 11385:  two senses. Firstly, one cannot act
ADDITION 11385:  the instant prior to creation while the created thing must not exist
DELETION 11386:  past
ADDITION 11386:  instant prior to creation
DELETION 11387:  Secondly,
ADDITION 11387:  Therefore a creator cannot create itself. Thus
DELETION 11388:  be and not be at the same time
ADDITION 11388:  create itself
DELETION 11389:  
ADDITION 11389:   
DELETION 11390:  The subsequent question of what created the universe, can be pointed to on
ADDITION 11390:  Yet
DELETION 11391:  basis of
ADDITION 11391:  idea that
DELETION 11392:  answer so far: Something outside
ADDITION 11392:  universe consists
DELETION 11393:  and time. Judging by
ADDITION 11393: -time fabric is contested on
DELETION 11394:  the observable universe it was something very powerful and precise
ADDITION 11394:  quantum mechanics
DELETION 11395:  Looking at humanity and our reason, our achievements in art
ADDITION 11395:  Space
DELETION 11396:  science

DELETION 11397:  our capacity for emotion and so on
ADDITION 11397:  may

DELETION 11399:  gave birth to unlimited potential

DELETION 11400:  Given
ADDITION 11400:  If
DELETION 11401:  unlikeliness of human potential flourishing I would
ADDITION 11401:  universe is defined to include this primal reality there may be scope for saying it created itself. However, to avoid an infinite regress you must
DELETION 11402:  whatever
ADDITION 11402:  something always existed (and
DELETION 11403:  the universe
ADDITION 11403:  other things) or
DELETION 11404:  we live in did so purposefully to enable human flourishing
ADDITION 11404:  something came from nothing
DELETION 11405:  But the question is whether it
ADDITION 11405:  Depending on how much your "nothing"
DELETION 11406:  nonsense
ADDITION 11406:  actually nothing you may be more or less inclined
DELETION 11407:  say
ADDITION 11407:  propose
DELETION 11408:  universe created itself. Well, strictly
ADDITION 11408:  notion that something comes from nothing
DELETION 11409:  yes
ADDITION 11409:  or that things can spontaneously occur without cause. If you do reject that
DELETION 11410:  reasons summarized here: to create one must exist
ADDITION 11410:  evidence before your senses that there is in fact something
DELETION 11411:  to be created one begins to exist when one
ADDITION 11411:  suggests that there always was something. The question then becomes what has always existed? Scientists mostly agree that the universe
DELETION 11412:  previously
ADDITION 11412:  always
DELETION 11413:  a thing cannot be

ADDITION 11505:  PERFORMANCE:     Clone batteries usually have larger claimed mAh capacities than original versions. You can pretty much guarantee that they are lying. If they lie about capacity it may not be a good sign re their other business practices :-). While it is possible to get more than typical capacities from a given size of LiIon cell, this is usually done at a cost. If you are making low cost product it's a lot easier and cheaper to print a lying label than to fit in more Li metal or afford and use industry leading edge practices that safely give more capacity.

DELETION 11849:  than mass loss due to e=m*c**2. But even so it isn't much. Ideally you would have enough mass loss, so that a planets radius would increase at just that rate that kept the stars luminosity divided by r squared constant, i.e. if that were the case the planet would stay within the habitable zone, even as the star brightened due to stellar evolution. Alas the solar wind is much too weak to accomplish the task. But we should be moving further out in any case.

DELETION 11884:  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
ADDITION 11884:  One can argue formally using the AdS/CFT correspondence that black hole formation and evaporation does not destroy information, contrary to earlier claims by Hawking that it must. This was the basis for Hawking's payoff of a bet he made with John Preskill. The bet, and a brief discussion of some of the issues involved can be found here 
DELETION 11885:  Important caveats are that there is no proof of AdS/CFT (although at this point it is very hard to believe it is not correct) and that the argument really doesn't tell one very explicitly just how the information manages to be encoded in the outgoing Hawking radiation.

DELETION 12746:  We introduce a blocking and regularization approach to estimate high-dimensional covariances using high-frequency data. Assets are first grouped according to liquidity. Using the multivariate realized kernel estimator of Barndorff-Nielsen et al. (2010), the covariance matrix is estimated block-wise and then regularized. The performance of the resulting blocking and regularization (RnB) estimator is analyzed in an extensive simulation study mimicking the liquidity and market microstructure features of the S&P 1500 universe. The RnB estimator yields efficiency gains for varying liquidity settings, noise-to-signal ratios and dimensions. An empirical application of estimating daily covariances of the S&P 500 index confirms the simulation results.

DELETION 13420:   I am unsure the
ADDITION 13420:   The
DELETION 13421:  ballpark
ADDITION 13421:  range of this is unknown
DELETION 13422:  we can estimate based on when a ship board gate begins to interfere with
ADDITION 13422:  I assume it is
DELETION 13423:  planet based gate
ADDITION 13423:  fairly large distance
DELETION 13424:   Also
ADDITION 13424:   Otherwise as the planets and their solar systems move through the galaxy they would leave the target area pretty quickly.  This throw/catch mechanism is necessary since even
DELETION 13425:  only 6

DELETION 13428:  reference than 38
ADDITION 13428:  a stargate across interstellar distances
DELETION 13429:  I assume that
ADDITION 13429:  This capturing is indicated by
DELETION 13430:   The
ADDITION 13430:  This spinning could either be the

ADDITION 13432:  or the receiving gate responding

ADDITION 13440:  wormhole jumps to the next shortest path
DELETION 13441:  it indicates
ADDITION 13441:  the second wormhole.  How stargates determine target precedence is
DELETION 13442:  completed connection
ADDITION 13442:  different question
DELETION 13443:  The sending of
ADDITION 13443:  If nothing goes wrong by now
DELETION 13444:  wormhole and
ADDITION 13444:  7th chevron on
DELETION 13445:  catching of a wormhole could distort subspace
ADDITION 13445:  origin gate locks
DELETION 13446: in the case of the control Ships.  Or since the Destiny gates don't have DHDs they may need to communicate with
ADDITION 13446:  all chevrons on
DELETION 13447:  prior to making a connection.  And intercepting that communication could be how the Control Ships detect stargate activity
ADDITION 13447:  lock
DELETION 13448:   We really don't have enough information about
ADDITION 13448:   This is where
DELETION 13449:  Destiny gates to know for sure.  The Goa'uld couldn't detect gate openings beyond
ADDITION 13449:  Kawoosh comes in, when
DELETION 13450:  planet
ADDITION 13450:  unstable wormhole interacts with
DELETION 13451:  planet were currently near
ADDITION 13451:  stargate's disintegration/reintegration
DELETION 13452:   And
ADDITION 13452:   Then
DELETION 13453:  Wraith used local probes that were activated by a gate within a short distance opening
ADDITION 13453:  stargates can communicate with each other to negotiate matter transmission, energy transmission, etc
DELETION 13454:  stellar drift occurs though,
ADDITION 13454:  long as
DELETION 13455:  points of
ADDITION 13455:  points
DELETION 13456:  shift, the targets shift, and
ADDITION 13456:  points in
DELETION 13457:  source gate shifts relative
ADDITION 13457:  stargate are fairly up
DELETION 13458:  each other.  Because of this after 5
ADDITION 13458:  date, say within 2-3
DELETION 13459:  without
ADDITION 13459: , all you need to dial is
DELETION 13460:  DHD
ADDITION 13460:  power source and an address.  If you are receiving you don't even need that, leading
DELETION 13461:  Earth stargate all of it's
ADDITION 13461:  occasional one way trip.  However, over time as stellar drift moves both the
DELETION 13462:  even if they had a current list
ADDITION 13462:  the stargates out
DELETION 13463:  addresses they would not get close enough to be caught by a receiving gate
ADDITION 13463:  the target area
DELETION 13464:  Because of it's closeness to Earth and similar relative motion only
ADDITION 13464:   This is why
DELETION 13465:  still in a place where the points of reference on stored in
ADDITION 13465:  only
DELETION 13466:  wormhole in the ballpark of Abydos
ADDITION 13466:  Earth gate could reach
DELETION 13467:  and

DELETION 13469:   Once the SGC had the cartouche temple on Abydos they then have a list of addresses they can feed into a program to predict where they could have moved and attempt to

DELETION 13746: , the Doctor(s) decide that instead of destroying Gallifrey, they should freeze it. Now for some reason, this involved ALL the Doctor's incarnations to perform some calculations that would take hundreds of years. However, why did this involve the Doctors 1-8 (I can understand why Capaldi came in as he is the future Doctor so maybe he comes back to help out or something)? Also, the idea of Doctors 1-8 performing these calculations that'll freeze the TARDIS may be plausible as they may have been doing so without realizing,but then why did all of the Tardis' (all 13 TARDIS') appear at the point where the 3 doctors in the main episode freeze Gallifrey. Shouldn't the Doctors 1-8 have had no involement at all as they are the past?

DELETION 13777:  I assume. That what is being said in all the comments, they would be 17-20 years old.  Applejack, Being the middle child of the Apple family, and a worker for the family, and of course being the last to get her cutie mark in her class, I would put her the oldest or second oldest of the Mane 6.
ADDITION 13777:  I assume. That what is being said in all the comments, they would be 17-20 years old. Since they are living home alone. Besides Pinkie Pie.  
DELETION 13778:  Granny Smith she's just a Earth Pony.

DELETION 13788: young
ADDITION 13788: Because Twilight being out of school in a manners of sorts, and being out of kindergarten school at that as well
DELETION 13789:  Now to Rarity. She owns her own tailor shop. So she can be around 20s? She could be hitching the same road with Applejack in the 20s.
ADDITION 13789:  And being the baby sister of Shining Armor, who Shining may be around 30s, due to him being the captain of the Royal Guard.
DELETION 13790:  Twilight Sparkle? I cooooould put her between the ages of... 17-19. Because Twilight being out of school in a manners of sorts, kindergarten school at that. And being the baby sister of Shining Armor, who Shining may be around 30s, due to him being the captain of the Royal Guard. And to add more common sense to this whole statement, since she is getting private schooling from Celestia, I would assume she may be the youngest of the mane 6.
ADDITION 13790:  And to add more common sense to this whole statement, since she is getting private schooling from Celestia, I would assume she may be the youngest of the mane 6, placing her at the age of 16.
DELETION 13791:  Granny Smith: Pretty damn old. 100-ish.
ADDITION 13791:  
DELETION 13792:  I would assume. That what is being said. 17-20 years old. Applejack. Beind the middle child of the Apple family, and a worker for the family, and of course being the last to get her cutie mark. I would put her the oldest or second oldest of the Mane 6. To why Granny SMith looks old and wrinkly. Luna and her sister are Alicorns, and are immortal. Can't die from age. Common sense to add to this. If being immortal. You would reach your max growth and stay that way. AWhile Granny Smith she's just a Earth Pony.  For Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash, well. I could say they may be the youngest of the other 6, but maybe not. To who is the oldest between the two. I could put Pinkie Pie around... 18 or 17- She foalsits and she bakes, and lives with strangers. Would you honestly trust your some kid to be left alone to cook and baby sit your kids? And Fluttershy did say is she a year older. So 18 or 19. Is my best guess. Rainbow Dash? I coooould say she is the same age as Pinkie Pie or Fluttershy. Since Dasihe and Fluttershy known each other since they were young. Now to Rarity. She owns her own tailor shop. So she can be around 20s? Hitching the same road with Applejack. Twilight Sparkle? I cooooould put her between the ages of... 17-19. So, yes. Twilight being out of school in a manners of sorts. And being the baby sister of Shinning, who may be around 30s. And adding more common sense. I can say she went through the rest of the school year too. She did get private schooling from Celstia. So. Applejack: 20-23 Rarity: 20-23 Twilight Sparkle: Assuming my best guess. 17. Rainbow Dash: 18 Fluttershy: 19. Pinkie Pie: 18 Granny Smith: Pretty damn old. 100-ish.

DELETION 14964:  There is a small velocity gain from the air launch. This isn't significant, but is there.
ADDITION 14964:  Falcon 1 is a LOX/RP liquid propellant rocket whereas Pegasus is solid rocket based. The technologies have vastly different thrust/weight ratios, specific impulse, and mass fractions. Solid rockets tend to have higher mass fractions and T/W because the engines are less complex (i.e. no pressurization systems, or plumbing, or turbo-pump machinery. But solids are typically more expensive, and typically have fixed impulse burns (i.e. they cannot be turned off). This is less of an issue for early stages, but the reason the Pegasus added the optional HAPS (hydrazine) final stage for precision orbit insertion.
DELETION 14965:  The Pegasus doesn't have to worry about changing inclinations, as the Falcon 9 does. But the specified numbers for Falcon 1 don't take in to account a varied inclination.
ADDITION 14965:  Because it is air-launched Pegasus can fly a different trajectory. Instead of a low angle-of-attack ascent followed by a gravity turn, Pegasus has wings. It flies at positive angle of attack and uses lift to aid in ascent.
DELETION 14966:  There is considerably less drag at 40,000 feet.
ADDITION 14966:  Engines at altitude can use a more efficient engine design (i.e. rocket nozzle expansion ratios tuned to atmospheric pressure at drop vice sea level.
DELETION 14967:  You are 10 km higher at altitude. This probably isn't significant.
ADDITION 14967:  There is a small velocity gain from the air launch. This isn't significant, but is there.

Two concurrent users hitting the app at the same time before all files were "spun up" created some really strange concurrency issues that only happened in that instance.  If the purpose of your testing is to check these initialization conditions under load, then definitely don't load them DLL's first. 2)  Load them up - For many applications, the application has been up and running for a while the next time someone hits it so most general performance testing is most "realistic" when the DLL's are pre-loaded.

ADDITION 18354:   Eye movement studies have been done in excess to determine the best placement for the most important call-to-action buttons.  And users often start in the upper-left hand corner.  On the other hand, these window buttons are so ubiquitous and so familiar that they shouldn't require unnecessary thought.  If a user is accustomed to an OS with the buttons on a certain side of the screen they will naturally be looking for them in that spot.  Past experience is going to be the dominant factor in what the user expects.

In addition, you will still see some page ranking returns for the old domain for at least 2 weeks afterwords, if not even longer.  This seems odd to me but I am assuming it is Google's caching system and if you do all of your redirects correctly it will not be an issue.
