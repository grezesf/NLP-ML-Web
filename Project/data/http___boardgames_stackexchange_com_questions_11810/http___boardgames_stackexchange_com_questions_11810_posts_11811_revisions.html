<p> When you are playing a game of magic, you are playing with/against <strong>another person</strong>.

<p> this is due to a <strong>shortcut</strong> listed in the rules, wherein the active player declares "attacks?" or "move to attack" or "combat" or some similar statement. This shortcut, in the literal sense, translates to "Pass priority up until you have priority in the Beginning of Combat step". The result of this shortcut is, if you move into the combat phase, you are automatically giving your opponent priority just before you declare attackers.

<p><strong>The latest safe opportunity to animate your man lands, or other permanents that become creatures through activating an ability, is in the <em>First Main Phase</em>.</strong> if you leave it until after this point, you are in the hands of your opponent and the judge staff for whether you get to activate the man land. If you cant demonstrate a good reason (for example, to empty some mana from your opponent's mana pool), they will probably not let you activate.</p>
