            <blockquote>
  <p>And this has been the case for quite
  some time. Functional programming
  simply has not become as popular as
  other models (i.e object oriented
  programming).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true if you only count programs developed by professional programmers (or at least people seeing themselves as such). If you spread your net wider to include programs developed by people not considering themselves as such, FP (or at least programming in a functional style) is pretty close to OO (Excel, Mathematica, Matlab, R... even 'modern' JavaScript).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In which scenarios should I consider a
  functional programming languages
  better suited to do a given task?
  Besides the so recently popular
  multicore problem of parallel
  programming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My personal opinion is that multicore is not the killer feature of FP (at least until Haskell, Scala, Clojure, F# compilers can reliably solve the cache locality issue), the killer feature is <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>fold</code> and friends which - very often - allow a much more succinct expression of a large group of algorithms. This if often compounded by FP languages often having a more concise syntax than it's popular OO counterparts.</p>

<p>Additionally FP being closer in spirit to the relational model, reduces the famed impedance mismatch with RDBMS... which is - again at least for non-programmers - very nice.</p>

<p>Also when you have particularly difficult to satisfy 'correctness' requirements - usually in the form that it is not really possible to cover them reliably with tests - a scenario common in scientific computing.large data analysis where the point of the computation is to get previously unknown - and as such un-specifiable- results.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I decided to switch to a functional
  programming language which do you
  consider are the biggest pitfalls that
  I will face?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Often lack of tool support, more difficulties when needing to squeeze out the last bit of performance from your hardware, sometimes communities focusing on different issues than these faced by a large group of commercial software development projects. Hard to find developers <strong>experienced</strong> in the use FP in an industrial setting... and if you find them you often have to compete with the benefits the financial industry can offer them. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With so many functional programming
  languages out there, how would you
  choose the one the better suit your
  needs?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How many of your issues can be solved by already exiting libraries/frameworks on which platform (e.g. JVM or .Net) how many are brand new? Or is there maybe even a language having constructs capable of expressing your problems directly?</p>

<p>How much low level control do you need over space and time performance of your application? </p>

<p>How strict are your "correctness" requirements?</p>

<p>Can you afford to retrain developers and/or compete with the benefits offered by some highly profitable niches in SW development?</p>
