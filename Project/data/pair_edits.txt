ADDITION 1581:  question:  Why would converting a 24-bit recording to

DELETION 1583:  audio quality downside in

DELETION 1584:  24 bit from
ADDITION 1584:  were done in 16-bit in
DELETION 1585:  start
ADDITION 1585:  first place
DELETION 1586:  You can't just "round" from 24
ADDITION 1586:  Think about what happens when rounding a number between 0 and 1: The information is either "included" (as a 1) or "removed" (set
DELETION 1587:  16 bits
ADDITION 1587:  0)
DELETION 1588:   How would you "round" the largest value
ADDITION 1588:   I.e., everything below 0.5 is "ignored" and everything greater than or equal to 0.5 is "enhanced"
DELETION 1589: 2^24 -
ADDITION 1589: increased to
DELETION 1590: ?  To the largest value in
ADDITION 1590: .  This is basically what happens to audio without dithering when converting from 24-bit to
DELETION 1591:  1?  That's off by
ADDITION 1591: bit.  Some information is completely removed, and some is altered, resulting in missing sounds and artifacts.  Dithering adds
DELETION 1592:  factor
ADDITION 1592:  random number to each value, meaning that some
DELETION 1593:  256
ADDITION 1593:  the values that would have been rounded down are now rounded up, and some values that would be rounded up are rounded down
DELETION 1594:   Not exactly acceptable error
ADDITION 1594:   This adds noise but prevents the weirdness introduced by pure rounding

DELETION 1637: LPC works by digitising the analog signal and splitting it into segments. For each of the segments we determine the key features of the signal and try to encode these as accurately as possible. The key features are the pitch of the signal (i.e. the basic formant frequency), the loudness of the signal and whether the sound is voiced or unvoiced. Parameters called vocal tract excitation parameters are also determined which are used in the vocal tract model to better model the state of the vocal tract which generated the sound. This data is passed over the network and decoded at the receiver. The pitch of the signal is used as input to either a voiced or unvoiced synthesiser, and the loudness data is used to boost the amplitude of this resulting signal. Finally the vocal cord model filters this sound by applying the LPC coefficients which were sent over the network.

DELETION 2135: 
- In Limited, your "sideboard" consists of all the cards from your pool that you didn't put in your deck, plus an unlimited supply of basic lands, should you need them.
- You don't have to make 1-for-1 substitutions when sideboarding. So, for instance, if I don't like how my deck runs 17/40 lands but fear 18/40 would be excessive, I can "side in" a land without removing anything to go up to 18/41 lands. The only restriction is that your final deck still has to be legal (i.e. no less than 40 cards).
- You don't have to "restore" your deck to any particular starting configuration for game 1 of each match. So there's no need to remember your starting configuration or undo a sideboard choice if you realized that it just runs better than your original 40-card list.

ADDITION 3671:  wasn't a hundred percent pure, it should not affect your mixture in such a way . The reason why your turkish delights turned wrong is more likely the fact you used FRUIT JUICE. When using agar agar to make candy or firmer gel bases, it is not recommended to use fruit juice since it contains acids wich makes the agar unable to set properly. If you want to make turkish delights with agar, I believe you better use flavoring and coloring... I would even say you should use these in any recipe wich involves agar agar,unless otherwise specified.

For this explanation the map is a square grid of tiles, because most 2D games use a grid of tiles and because that's simple to visualize. Note however that the search area can be broken up in any way you want: a hex grid perhaps, or even arbitrary shapes like Risk. The various map positions are referred to as "nodes" and this algorithm will work any time you have a bunch of nodes to traverse and have defined connections between the nodes.

ADDITION 6277:  need to worry about
DELETION 6278:  into a component- and event-driven game engine.  Consider what a game state is: a simple conditional

DELETION 6280:  code can access

DELETION 6281:  then all parts of your code can react based on the

DELETION 6283:  I don't know how you handle your components
ADDITION 6283:  At most
DELETION 6284: , but the idea is
ADDITION 6284:  might want to build a component
DELETION 6285:  you can maintain
ADDITION 6285:  encapsulates
DELETION 6286: ), then let the GameStateSystem determine the state of the game
ADDITION 6286:  That way
DELETION 6287:  and pass the event
ADDITION 6287:  these components could be consumed by various systems
DELETION 6288:  the active Component.  Your component then receives the event, and does whatever it should with the input
ADDITION 6288:  react to
DELETION 6289:  I will say this, however:
ADDITION 6289:  It seems management systems such as
DELETION 6290:  procedural game loop exists for a reason
ADDITION 6290:  AppHub example do not apply very well to your development paradigm

Where did shepards squadmates go and why are they on the normandy flying away from the battle?  Sgt Cortes (or whatever he is called) clearly states no one made it to the beam, yet how did he not see shepard and anderson go through? While talking with the boy (catalyst) you can still hear gunfire how when your the only thing alive on the citadel? The boy must be the reapers way to control shepards emotions and try to get him to control or synthesise the galaxy so that the reapers are still alive and kicking.

DELETION 8232:  The CISG is the law
ADDITION 8232:  This

DELETION 8237:  "This Constitution

DELETION 8249:  As far as I know the International Court of Justice, like apoorv020 said, is the only place that it makes sense for one sovereign state to sue another sovereign state
ADDITION 8249:  These principles come from long ago established international law
DELETION 8250:  One of the most famous cases along these lines is
ADDITION 8250:  There are only four scenarios by which a court can exercise jurisdiction over a party

He was (and still has been) an outspoken supporter of both the United States and Israel, and was (and probably still has been) told repeatedly by those in the government that if he would simply stop speaking out in support of Israel, he would be given the full backing of the Iraqi leadership. Instead, he continued to speak out on Israel's behalf, and was stripped of his security detail, threatened with death, and lost his two sons in a bomb attack meant to kill him.

ADDITION 8698:  Indeed, while visiting a website to research information for a question posted on JL&L, I came across a learning-oriented website which automatically redirected me to a "sorry, we're closed for Shabbos page" --- except it was not Shabbos yet
DELETION 8699:  technical implementation: You can't just go blocking your
ADDITION 8699: . (For the record it was late Friday afternoon, but still over an hour before sunset)
DELETION 8700:  random hours because you'll end up shutting out legitimate
ADDITION 8700:  the same time preventing me from learning about an interesting Jewish topic. Moral of the story: Be absolutely sure your technical implementation is airtight

DELETION 8702:  different timezones
ADDITION 8702:  mind
DELETION 8703:  who can get really upset
ADDITION 8703:  it's hard to give a one-size fits all approach
DELETION 8704:  So what you
ADDITION 8704:  Essentially there are three problems:
DELETION 8705:  want
ADDITION 8705:  be to do the redirect server-side. So the first thing we can try
DELETION 8706:  use
ADDITION 8706:  get the users location for the timezone by using
DELETION 8707:  Geolocation
ADDITION 8707:  Geo-location: Except...
DELETION 8708:  find their approximate location
ADDITION 8708:  work right many times
DELETION 8709:  calculate the zmanim
ADDITION 8709:  but that only holds true if an IP always reflects a user's location. Which it doesn't
DELETION 8710: sunrise/sunset
ADDITION 8710: proxy server, dial-up, bad info, etc.
DELETION 8711:  for that latitude/longitude
ADDITION 8711: .
DELETION 8712:  then put
ADDITION 8712:  it told me I was in Massachusetts. Sorry, but
DELETION 8713:  little logic into your home page
ADDITION 8713:  simple reading of 
DELETION 8714: However
ADDITION 8714: (again, less elegant), we can 
DELETION 8715:  can
ADDITION 8715:  was accurate we could get it from there. A possible solution to this problem is to
DELETION 8716:  inaccurate in many cases
ADDITION 8716:  lenient. In other words
DELETION 8717:  especially where
ADDITION 8717:  in a given timezone (which we know
DELETION 8718:  using a proxy
ADDITION 8718:  in)
DELETION 8719:  or
ADDITION 8719:  what's the latest possible sunset? If the user's time
DELETION 8720:  dialing into a far away location
ADDITION 8720:  past that, then redirect, otherwise keep him here
DELETION 8721:  So
ADDITION 8721:  Finally, as for problem #3:
DELETION 8722:  may still want to keep it to a warning page
ADDITION 8722:  can actually output the server's GMT time [I would sincerely hope it's accurate!] directly into the Javascript code
DELETION 8723:  give
ADDITION 8723:  do

It is well known that for many years the eda haharedit would give hechsher to wine/juice that has enough water in the mixture to be considered water for sefaradim. The Rav Ovadia would say that it is not only not casher for kidush but we say sheacol to drink. Because of this, today many wineries print that their wine/juice is also casher for havdala and kidush as the opinion of the maran habet iosef

DELETION 8878:  Both are used, but I believe linguists prefer the former. Grammaticality, as one linguist explained it to me, means "following the rules of the relevant scientific model that is used to describe how people speak". So it is strictly dependent on the model used, but in practice many linguists presume that there is consensus about most elements of the relevant model, so it mostly overlaps with "people actually use this within a certain group and they consider it normal". 
ADDITION 8878: :
DELETION 8879:  The word "incorrect" may suggest that there is something wrong with straying from grammatically; I suspect that linguists do not use this much because they resent the implication. So I think that's why you will mostly see ungrammatical.

$$
M=\bigoplus\sum_{i=1}^rR/p_i(T)R,

where always $p_i(T)|p_{i+1}(T)$. I claim that here actually $r=1$ and $p_r(T)=q(T)=T^n-1

DELETION 9855:  a leak that allows rain water to collect in the car. Check to see if the rugs are damp,look in the storage well behind the seat and any place water might collect. Do you also notice a sweet smell when the engine gets warm? If you do it may be a leaking heater core. Antifreeze could be leaking into the heater box then the vapor is fogging the windshield. Antifreeze residue can be difficult to remove from the windsshield. Try rubbing a clean tissue on the inside of the glass. The tissue may show the oily component of the antifreeze.It may be a small leak as a little antifreeze goes along way in terms of fogging the glass. The third source could be the A/C. The A/C unit removes humidity from the air. This is what causes the puddle under the car when the A/C is running. Sometimes the drain get clogged with leaves or pine needles. This allows the water to build up which adds humidity when you run the defroster. If enough has collected you may hear it sloshing under the dash when you make a turn.

It could seem as though we need to follow a rule to follow a rule (an infinite regression). That is, there would be a certain rule for applying rules by some similarity of circumstances; of course, it gets somewhat tricky for something like mathematics--where we often change the elements of the system to build foundations (e.g. the change in the concept of number that Dedekind and Canton brought about), and thus, are still expected to follow certain rules in new (but perhaps analogous) circumstances. (To identify situational analogs seems to be another sort of rule following.) The point is that it seems our minds "fill in the blanks," so to speak, of what is unknown by what we know. But it's also unclear why there is certainty when we apply a rule to new sets of problems.

DELETION 11547:  "Suppose that a judge or magistrate is faced with rioters demanding that a culprit be found for a certain crime and threatening otherwise to take their own bloody revenge on a particular section of the community. The real culprit being unknown, the judge sees himself as able to prevent the bloodshed only by framing some innocent person and having him executed. Beside this example is placed another in which a pilot whose aeroplane is about to crash is deciding whether to steer from a more to a less inhabited area. To make the parallel as close as possible it may rather be supposed that he is the driver of a runaway tram which he can only steer from one narrow track on to another; five men are working on one track and one man on the other; anyone on the track he enters is bound to be killed. In the case of the riots the mob have five hostages, so that in both the exchange is supposed to be one man's life for the lives of five."

DELETION 11661:  but what
ADDITION 11661:  the universe. What
DELETION 11662:  that? The
ADDITION 11662:  the
DELETION 11663:  is space and time
ADDITION 11663: ? There are many competing definitions available
DELETION 11664:  Space being filled with physical matter and
ADDITION 11664:  For
DELETION 11665:  forces
ADDITION 11665:  purpose of this discussion I would like to appeal to scientific defintions.

DELETION 11671:  Matter does not exist outside
ADDITION 11671:  The article this appears in goes on to describe that space and time are part of a single four dimensional fabric that can be modelled mathematically in ways that are very useful for predicting the behaviour
DELETION 11672:  and
ADDITION 11672:  nor can
DELETION 11673:  matter
ADDITION 11673:  space
DELETION 11674:  Since, in the creation of the universe we have an event in which both of these things are being created simultaneously
ADDITION 11674:  Both include each other. If
DELETION 11675:  that
ADDITION 11675:  consists of this fabric, I would argue that self-creation
DELETION 11676:  created at any other point than
ADDITION 11676:  not possible. The reason for that is that on this model

DELETION 11685:  But we know that
ADDITION 11685:  I believe

ADDITION 11686:  answer to this is obvious
DELETION 11687:  where
ADDITION 11687:  so I will proceed without the support of refernces for this point. Let us say, at least for
DELETION 11688:  is there is time and space

DELETION 11691:  time and space and create itself before time

DELETION 11692:  as it would

DELETION 11693:  be itself at
ADDITION 11693:  exist in the instant prior to creation in order
DELETION 11694:  would
ADDITION 11694:  may
DELETION 11695:  something else
ADDITION 11695:  created
DELETION 11696:  To answer briefly the question of whether
ADDITION 11696:  This presents two opposing requirements that cannot be reconciled in
DELETION 11697:  universe can create itself: no
ADDITION 11697:  one thing
DELETION 11698:  time forbids it
ADDITION 11698:  the creator must exist
DELETION 11699:  two senses. Firstly, one cannot act
ADDITION 11699:  the instant prior to creation while the created thing must not exist
DELETION 11700:  past
ADDITION 11700:  instant prior to creation
DELETION 11701:  Secondly,
ADDITION 11701:  Therefore a creator cannot create itself. Thus
DELETION 11702:  be and not be at the same time
ADDITION 11702:  create itself
DELETION 11703:  
ADDITION 11703:   
DELETION 11704:  The subsequent question of what created the universe, can be pointed to on
ADDITION 11704:  Yet
DELETION 11705:  basis of
ADDITION 11705:  idea that
DELETION 11706:  answer so far: Something outside
ADDITION 11706:  universe consists
DELETION 11707:  and time. Judging by
ADDITION 11707: -time fabric is contested on

DELETION 11715:  unlikeliness of human potential flourishing I would
ADDITION 11715:  universe is defined to include this primal reality there may be scope for saying it created itself. However, to avoid an infinite regress you must
DELETION 11716:  whatever

DELETION 11718:  we live in did so purposefully to enable human flourishing
ADDITION 11718:  something came from nothing
DELETION 11719:  But the question is whether it
ADDITION 11719:  Depending on how much your "nothing"
DELETION 11720:  nonsense
ADDITION 11720:  actually nothing you may be more or less inclined
DELETION 11721:  say

DELETION 11722:  universe created itself. Well, strictly
ADDITION 11722:  notion that something comes from nothing
DELETION 11723:  yes
ADDITION 11723:  or that things can spontaneously occur without cause. If you do reject that
DELETION 11724:  reasons summarized here: to create one must exist
ADDITION 11724:  evidence before your senses that there is in fact something
DELETION 11725:  to be created one begins to exist when one
ADDITION 11725:  suggests that there always was something. The question then becomes what has always existed? Scientists mostly agree that the universe
DELETION 11726:  previously

ADDITION 11821:  PERFORMANCE:     Clone batteries usually have larger claimed mAh capacities than original versions. You can pretty much guarantee that they are lying. If they lie about capacity it may not be a good sign re their other business practices :-). While it is possible to get more than typical capacities from a given size of LiIon cell, this is usually done at a cost. If you are making low cost product it's a lot easier and cheaper to print a lying label than to fit in more Li metal or afford and use industry leading edge practices that safely give more capacity.

 - rings have no glass, so they don't reduce light, change color quality, or reduce sharpness
 - rings can stack, multiplying the effect
 - rings without AF support can be extremely inexpensive
 - filters can sometimes not carry additional filters on top of them - this can make it difficult if you want to attach a polarizer or some other filter
 - filters cannot be used on all cameras, unless you buy a larger one (77mm for your 24-70) and also buy a step down ring.

Ideally you would have enough mass loss, so that a planets radius would increase at just that rate that kept the stars luminosity divided by r squared constant, i.e. if that were the case the planet would stay within the habitable zone, even as the star brightened due to stellar evolution. Alas the solar wind is much too weak to accomplish the task. But we should be moving further out in any case.

DELETION 12201:  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
ADDITION 12201:  One can argue formally using the AdS/CFT correspondence that black hole formation and evaporation does not destroy information, contrary to earlier claims by Hawking that it must. This was the basis for Hawking's payoff of a bet he made with John Preskill. The bet, and a brief discussion of some of the issues involved can be found here 
DELETION 12202:  Important caveats are that there is no proof of AdS/CFT (although at this point it is very hard to believe it is not correct) and that the argument really doesn't tell one very explicitly just how the information manages to be encoded in the outgoing Hawking radiation.

Applying the continuum limit (QFT), Why does the creation operator take a continuum value for the momentum?Shouldn't it take only discrete values ?
 In the discrete lattice are these quantized vibrations what are called phonones?What are the factors that determines the speed at which these phonons propagate?
In the continuum limit,Assuming that the field occupy a finite volume , What is the effect of the boundry conditions on the dynamics of the field ?
In CM  What should the entropy of this system ? and Similarly the Same question in QM?

We introduce a blocking and regularization approach to estimate high-dimensional covariances using high-frequency data. Assets are first grouped according to liquidity. Using the multivariate realized kernel estimator of Barndorff-Nielsen et al. (2010), the covariance matrix is estimated block-wise and then regularized. The performance of the resulting blocking and regularization (RnB) estimator is analyzed in an extensive simulation study mimicking the liquidity and market microstructure features of the S&P 1500 universe. The RnB estimator yields efficiency gains for varying liquidity settings, noise-to-signal ratios and dimensions. An empirical application of estimating daily covariances of the S&P 500 index confirms the simulation results.

DELETION 13781:   Also

DELETION 13798:  it indicates
ADDITION 13798:  the second wormhole.  How stargates determine target precedence is
DELETION 13799:  completed connection
ADDITION 13799:  different question
DELETION 13800:  The sending of
ADDITION 13800:  If nothing goes wrong by now
DELETION 13801:  wormhole and
ADDITION 13801:  7th chevron on
DELETION 13802:  catching of a wormhole could distort subspace
ADDITION 13802:  origin gate locks
DELETION 13803: in the case of the control Ships.  Or since the Destiny gates don't have DHDs they may need to communicate with
ADDITION 13803:  all chevrons on
DELETION 13804:  prior to making a connection.  And intercepting that communication could be how the Control Ships detect stargate activity
ADDITION 13804:  lock
DELETION 13805:   We really don't have enough information about
ADDITION 13805:   This is where
DELETION 13806:  Destiny gates to know for sure.  The Goa'uld couldn't detect gate openings beyond
ADDITION 13806:  Kawoosh comes in, when
DELETION 13807:  planet

DELETION 13808:  planet were currently near
ADDITION 13808:  stargate's disintegration/reintegration
DELETION 13809:   And
ADDITION 13809:   Then
DELETION 13810:  Wraith used local probes that were activated by a gate within a short distance opening
ADDITION 13810:  stargates can communicate with each other to negotiate matter transmission, energy transmission, etc
DELETION 13811:  stellar drift occurs though,
ADDITION 13811:  long as
DELETION 13812:  points of
ADDITION 13812:  points
DELETION 13813:  shift, the targets shift, and
ADDITION 13813:  points in
DELETION 13814:  source gate shifts relative
ADDITION 13814:  stargate are fairly up
DELETION 13815:  each other.  Because of this after 5
ADDITION 13815:  date, say within 2-3
DELETION 13816:  without
ADDITION 13816: , all you need to dial is
DELETION 13817:  DHD
ADDITION 13817:  power source and an address.  If you are receiving you don't even need that, leading
DELETION 13818:  Earth stargate all of it's
ADDITION 13818:  occasional one way trip.  However, over time as stellar drift moves both the
DELETION 13819:  even if they had a current list
ADDITION 13819:  the stargates out
DELETION 13820:  addresses they would not get close enough to be caught by a receiving gate
ADDITION 13820:  the target area
DELETION 13821:  Because of it's closeness to Earth and similar relative motion only
ADDITION 13821:   This is why
DELETION 13822:  still in a place where the points of reference on stored in

DELETION 13823:  wormhole in the ballpark of Abydos
ADDITION 13823:  Earth gate could reach
DELETION 13824:  and
ADDITION 13824:  work.  Once they discovered the Abydos DHD and Daniel showed them the  cartouche temple, the SGC had a baseline list of addresses that should
DELETION 13825: and then
ADDITION 13825:   then
DELETION 13826:   Once the SGC had the cartouche temple on Abydos they then have a list of addresses they can feed into a program to predict where they could have moved and attempt to

DELETION 14116: , the Doctor(s) decide that instead of destroying Gallifrey, they should freeze it. Now for some reason, this involved ALL the Doctor's incarnations to perform some calculations that would take hundreds of years. However, why did this involve the Doctors 1-8 (I can understand why Capaldi came in as he is the future Doctor so maybe he comes back to help out or something)? Also, the idea of Doctors 1-8 performing these calculations that'll freeze the TARDIS may be plausible as they may have been doing so without realizing,but then why did all of the Tardis' (all 13 TARDIS') appear at the point where the 3 doctors in the main episode freeze Gallifrey. Shouldn't the Doctors 1-8 have had no involement at all as they are the past?

ADDITION 14159:  And being the baby sister of Shining Armor, who Shining may be
around 30s, due to him being the captain of the Royal Guard.
DELETION 14160:  Twilight Sparkle? I cooooould put her between the ages of... 17-19.
Because Twilight being out of school in a manners of sorts,
kindergarten school at that. And being the baby sister of Shining
Armor, who Shining may be around 30s, due to him being the captain
of the Royal Guard. And to add more common sense to this whole
statement, since she is getting private schooling from Celestia, I
would assume she may be the youngest of the mane 6.

DELETION 14162:  I would assume. That what is being said. 17-20 years old. Applejack. Beind the middle child of the Apple family, and a worker for the family, and of course being the last to get her cutie mark. I would put her the oldest or second oldest of the Mane 6. To why Granny SMith looks old and wrinkly. Luna and her sister are Alicorns, and are immortal. Can't die from age. Common sense to add to this. If being immortal. You would reach your max growth and stay that way. AWhile Granny Smith she's just a Earth Pony.  For Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash, well. I could say they may be the youngest of the other 6, but maybe not. To who is the oldest between the two. I could put Pinkie Pie around... 18 or 17- She foalsits and she bakes, and lives with strangers. Would you honestly trust your some kid to be left alone to cook and baby sit your kids? And Fluttershy did say is she a year older. So 18 or 19. Is my best guess. Rainbow Dash? I coooould say she is the same age as Pinkie Pie or Fluttershy. Since Dasihe and Fluttershy known each other since they were young. Now to Rarity. She owns her own tailor shop. So she can be around 20s? Hitching the same road with Applejack. Twilight Sparkle? I cooooould put her between the ages of... 17-19. So, yes. Twilight being out of school in a manners of sorts. And being the baby sister of Shinning, who may be around 30s. And adding more common sense. I can say she went through the rest of the school year too. She did get private schooling from Celstia. So.

DELETION 15359:  There is a small velocity gain from the air launch. This isn't significant, but is there.
ADDITION 15359:  Falcon 1 is a LOX/RP liquid propellant rocket whereas Pegasus is solid rocket based. The technologies have vastly different thrust/weight ratios, specific impulse, and mass fractions. Solid rockets tend to have higher mass fractions and T/W because the engines are less complex (i.e. no pressurization systems, or plumbing, or turbo-pump machinery. But solids are typically more expensive, and typically have fixed impulse burns (i.e. they cannot be turned off). This is less of an issue for early stages, but the reason the Pegasus added the optional HAPS (hydrazine) final stage for precision orbit insertion.
DELETION 15360:  The Pegasus doesn't have to worry about changing inclinations, as the Falcon 9 does. But the specified numbers for Falcon 1 don't take in to account a varied inclination.
ADDITION 15360:  Because it is air-launched Pegasus can fly a different trajectory. Instead of a low angle-of-attack ascent followed by a gravity turn, Pegasus has wings. It flies at positive angle of attack and uses lift to aid in ascent.
DELETION 15361:  There is considerably less drag at 40,000 feet.
ADDITION 15361:  Engines at altitude can use a more efficient engine design (i.e. rocket nozzle expansion ratios tuned to atmospheric pressure at drop vice sea level.
DELETION 15362:  You are 10 km higher at altitude. This probably isn't significant.

DELETION 15709:  1)  Don't load them - There are a number of problems I've uncovered with a web application where the DLL's and other such objects were not loaded in memory first.  Two concurrent users hitting the app at the same time before all files were "spun up" created some really strange concurrency issues that only happened in that instance.  If the purpose of your testing is to check these initialization conditions under load, then definitely don't load them DLL's first.
2)  Load them up - For many applications, the application has been up and running for a while the next time someone hits it so most general performance testing is most "realistic" when the DLL's are pre-loaded.

DELETION 16957: Another popular approach is to build a slightly more complex model for predicting monetary value based on two sub-models: one for probability of response (e.g. using logistic regression as a function of RFM), and the other for revenue conditional on response (again, it could be as simple as a linear model of RFM). Expected monetary value is the product of the two predictions.
ADDITION 16957: I already had my logistic regression output, but I don't know how to mix the response given by it (probability of response) in order to run, for instance, a linear regression for revenue. As you might realize, in the answer quoted above, it's said that it's done conditionally on response, but how can be this carried out? How can I mix those models?

ADDITION 18871:   Eye movement studies have been done in excess to determine the best placement for the most important call-to-action buttons.  And users often start in the upper-left hand corner.  On the other hand, these window buttons are so ubiquitous and so familiar that they shouldn't require unnecessary thought.  If a user is accustomed to an OS with the buttons on a certain side of the screen they will naturally be looking for them in that spot.  Past experience is going to be the dominant factor in what the user expects.

ADDITION 19626:   For instance Google may try to search for specific pages from its cache on the old domain and any related errors will show up for you old domain. In addition, you will still see some page ranking returns for the old domain for at least 2 weeks afterwords, if not even longer.  This seems odd to me but I am assuming it is Google's caching system and if you do all of your redirects correctly it will not be an issue.
