  <h2>What is Energy?</h2>
  
  <p> In this chapter, we begin our more detailed study of the different
  aspects of physics, having finished our description of things in
  general. To illustrate the ideas and the kind of reasoning that might
  be used in theoretical physics, we shall now examine one of the most
  basic laws of physics, the conservation of energy.
        There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all natural
  phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this
  law—it is exact so far as we know. The law is called the conservation
  of energy. It states that there is a certain quantity, which we call
  energy, that does not change in the manifold changes which nature
  undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a mathematical
  principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity which does not
  change when something happens. It is not a description of a mechanism,
  or any- thing concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can
  calculate some number and when we finish watching nature go through
  her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same. (Something
  like the bishop on a red square, and after a number of moves—details
  unknown—it is still on some red square. It is a law of this nature.)
  Since it is an abstract idea, we shall illustrate the meaning of it by
  an analogy.
        Imagine a child, perhaps "Dennis the Menace," who has blocks
  which are absolutely indestructible, and cannot be divided into
  pieces. Each is the same as the other. Let us suppose that he has 28
  blocks. His mother puts him with his 28 blocks into a room at the
  beginning of the day. At the end of the day, being curious, she counts
  the blocks very carefully, and discovers a phenomenal law— no matter
  what he does with the blocks, there are always 28 remaining! This
  continues for a number of days, until one day there are only 27
  blocks, but a little investigating shows that there is one under the
  rug—she must look everywhere to be sure that the number of blocks has
  not changed. One day, however, the number appears to change—there are
  only 26 blocks. Careful investigation in- dicates that the window was
  open, and upon looking outside, the other two blocks are found.
  Another day, careful count indicates that there are 30 blocks! This
  causes considerable consternation, until it is realized that Bruce
  came to visit, bringing his blocks with him, and he left a few at
  Dennis' house. After she has  disposed of the extra blocks, she closes
  the window, does not let Bruce in, and then everything is going along
  all right, until one time she counts and finds only 25  blocks.
  However, there is a box in the room, a toy box, and the mother goes to
  open the toy box, but the boy says "No, do not open my toy box," and
  screams.  Mother is not allowed to open the toy box. Being extremely
  curious, and somewhat  ingenious, she invents a scheme! She knows that
  a block weighs three ounces,  so she weighs the box at a time when she
  sees 28 blocks, and it weighs 16 ounces.  The next time she wishes to
  check, she weighs the box again, subtracts sixteen  ounces and divides
  by three. She discovers the following: <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/LIGAT.jpg" alt="Equation 4.1"> There then
  appear to be some new deviations, but careful study indicates that the
  dirty water in the bathtub is changing its level. The child is
  throwing blocks into the water, and she cannot see them because it is
  so dirty, but she can find out how many blocks are in the water by
  adding another term to her formula. Since the original height of the
  water was 6 inches and each block raises the water a quarter of an
  inch, this new formula would be: <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/eX2pp.jpg" alt="Equation 4.2">
       In the gradual increase in the complexity of her world, she finds
  a whole series of terms representing ways of calculating how many
  blocks are in places where she is not allowed to look. As a result,
  she finds a complex formula, a quantity which has to be computed,
  which always stays the same in her situation.
       What is the analogy of this to the conservation of energy?<span class="diff-delete"> The
  most re- markable aspect that must be abstracted from this picture is
  that there are no blocks. Take away the first terms in</span> <span class="diff-delete">(4.1) and (4.2)
  and we find ourselves calculating more or less abstract things. The</span><em><span class="diff-add">The
  most re- markable aspect that must be abstracted from this picture is
  that there are no blocks. Take away the first terms in (4.1) and (4.2)
  and we find ourselves calculating more or less abstract things.</span></em> <span class="diff-add">The</span>
  analogy has the following points. First, when we are calculating the
  energy, sometimes some of it leaves the system and goes away, or
  sometimes some comes in. In order to verify the conservation of
  energy, we must be careful that we have not put any in or taken any
  out. Second, the energy has a large number of different forms, and
  there is a formula for each one. These are: gravitational energy,
  kinetic energy, heat energy, elastic energy, electrical energy,
  chemical energy, radiant energy, nuclear energy, mass energy. If we
  total up the formulas for each of these contributions, it will not
  change except for energy going in and out.
       <strong>It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no
  knowledge of what energy is</strong>. We do not have a picture that energy
  comes in little blobs of a definite amount. It is not that way.
  However, there are formulas for calculating some numerical quantity,
  and when we add it all together it gives "28"'—always the same number.
  It is an abstract thing in that it does not tell us the mechanism or
  the reasons for the various formulas.</p>

  <h2>What is Energy?</h2>
  
  <p> In this chapter, we begin our more detailed study of the different
  aspects of physics, having finished our description of things in
  general. To illustrate the ideas and the kind of reasoning that might
  be used in theoretical physics, we shall now examine one of the most
  basic laws of physics, the conservation of energy.
        There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all natural
  phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this
  law—it is exact so far as we know. The law is called the conservation
  of energy. It states that there is a certain quantity, which we call
  energy, that does not change in the manifold changes which nature
  undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a mathematical
  principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity which does not
  change when something happens. It is not a description of a mechanism,
  or any- thing concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can
  calculate some number and when we finish watching nature go through
  her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same. (Something
  like the bishop on a red square, and after a number of moves—details
  unknown—it is still on some red square. It is a law of this nature.)
  Since it is an abstract idea, we shall illustrate the meaning of it by
  an analogy.
        Imagine a child, perhaps "Dennis the Menace," who has blocks
  which are absolutely indestructible, and cannot be divided into
  pieces. Each is the same as the other. Let us suppose that he has 28
  blocks. His mother puts him with his 28 blocks into a room at the
  beginning of the day. At the end of the day, being curious, she counts
  the blocks very carefully, and discovers a phenomenal law— no matter
  what he does with the blocks, there are always 28 remaining! This
  continues for a number of days, until one day there are only 27
  blocks, but a little investigating shows that there is one under the
  rug—she must look everywhere to be sure that the number of blocks has
  not changed. One day, however, the number appears to change—there are
  only 26 blocks. Careful investigation in- dicates that the window was
  open, and upon looking outside, the other two blocks are found.
  Another day, careful count indicates that there are 30 blocks! This
  causes considerable consternation, until it is realized that Bruce
  came to visit, bringing his blocks with him, and he left a few at
  Dennis' house. After she has  disposed of the extra blocks, she closes
  the window, does not let Bruce in, and then everything is going along
  all right, until one time she counts and finds only 25  blocks.
  However, there is a box in the room, a toy box, and the mother goes to
  open the toy box, but the boy says "No, do not open my toy box," and
  screams.  Mother is not allowed to open the toy box. Being extremely
  curious, and somewhat  ingenious, she invents a scheme! She knows that
  a block weighs three ounces,  so she weighs the box at a time when she
  sees 28 blocks, and it weighs 16 ounces.  The next time she wishes to
  check, she weighs the box again, subtracts sixteen  ounces and divides
  by three. She discovers the following: <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/LIGAT.jpg" alt="Equation 4.1"> There then

        <h1>Do fundamental concepts in physics have any logical basis?</h1>

        <div class="post-text">
            <p>After years of studying physics I am suddenly struck by the question - What is energy? Wikipedia defines it thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Energy is often understood as the ability a physical system has to do
  work on other physical systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that is the case, what is work? From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In physics, work is the amount of energy transferred by a force acting
  through a distance in the direction of the force.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isn't this a cyclic argument? Energy is explained based on work is explained in terms of energy.</p>

<p>Again, in the second definition, what is force? From Wikipedia</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In physics, a force is any influence that causes a free body to
  undergo a change in speed, a change in direction, or a change in
  shape.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Has anyone ever seen force, touched it, tasted it, dissected it etc? Sure, we say we know the <em>effect</em> of force - but does anyone really know what force itself is? A similar argument can apply to energy &amp; work as well, does anyone know what they are?</p>

<p>This type of definition seems to me, as baseless as the statement - "God is the cause due to which the universe exists."</p>

<p>Some argue that we have an intuitive understanding of concepts such as energy,force etc &amp; that no definition or verification is necessary but then again, many clerics also justify faith in God using a similar argument - that God exists &amp; that no verification or definition is necessary or possible.</p>

<p>The foundations of Physics seem to be as feeble as those of Religion. Can anyone help me? </p>
