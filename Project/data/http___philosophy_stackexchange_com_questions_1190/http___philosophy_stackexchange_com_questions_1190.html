        <p>After years of studying physics I am suddenly struck by the question - What is energy? Wikipedia defines it thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Energy is often understood as the ability a physical system has to do
  work on other physical systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that is the case, what is work? From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In physics, work is the amount of energy transferred by a force acting
  through a distance in the direction of the force.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isn't this a cyclic argument? Energy is explained based on work is explained in terms of energy.</p>

<p>Again, in the second definition, what is force? From Wikipedia</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In physics, a force is any influence that causes a free body to
  undergo a change in speed, a change in direction, or a change in
  shape.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Has anyone ever seen force, touched it, tasted it, dissected it etc? Sure, we say we know the <em>effect</em> of force - but does anyone really know what force itself is? A similar argument can apply to energy &amp; work as well, does anyone know what they are?</p>

<p>This type of definition seems to me, as baseless as the statement - "God is the cause due to which the universe exists."</p>

<p>Some argue that we have an intuitive understanding of concepts such as energy,force etc &amp; that no definition or verification is necessary but then again, many clerics also justify faith in God using a similar argument - that God exists &amp; that no verification or definition is necessary or possible.</p>

<p>The foundations of Physics seem to be as feeble as those of Religion. Can anyone help me?</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<hr>

<p>@Michael Dorfman Thanks for the great answer and also the reference to Richard Feynman. I looked up <em>The Feynman Lectures</em> &amp; found the following extract very relevant to this question. I think it'll greatly enhance the quality this post.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>What is Energy?</h2>
  
  <p>In this chapter, we begin our more detailed study of the different
  aspects of physics, having finished our description of things in
  general. To illustrate the ideas and the kind of reasoning that might
  be used in theoretical physics, we shall now examine one of the most
  basic laws of physics, the conservation of energy.
        There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all natural
  phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this
  law—it is exact so far as we know. The law is called the conservation
  of energy. It states that there is a certain quantity, which we call
  energy, that does not change in the manifold changes which nature
  undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a mathematical
  principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity which does not
  change when something happens. It is not a description of a mechanism,
  or any- thing concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can
  calculate some number and when we finish watching nature go through
  her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same. (Something
  like the bishop on a red square, and after a number of moves—details
  unknown—it is still on some red square. It is a law of this nature.)
  Since it is an abstract idea, we shall illustrate the meaning of it by
  an analogy.
        Imagine a child, perhaps "Dennis the Menace," who has blocks
  which are absolutely indestructible, and cannot be divided into
  pieces. Each is the same as the other. Let us suppose that he has 28
  blocks. His mother puts him with his 28 blocks into a room at the
  beginning of the day. At the end of the day, being curious, she counts
  the blocks very carefully, and discovers a phenomenal law— no matter
  what he does with the blocks, there are always 28 remaining! This
  continues for a number of days, until one day there are only 27
  blocks, but a little investigating shows that there is one under the
  rug—she must look everywhere to be sure that the number of blocks has
  not changed. One day, however, the number appears to change—there are
  only 26 blocks. Careful investigation in- dicates that the window was
  open, and upon looking outside, the other two blocks are found.
  Another day, careful count indicates that there are 30 blocks! This
  causes considerable consternation, until it is realized that Bruce
  came to visit, bringing his blocks with him, and he left a few at
  Dennis' house. After she has  disposed of the extra blocks, she closes
  the window, does not let Bruce in, and then everything is going along
  all right, until one time she counts and finds only 25  blocks.
  However, there is a box in the room, a toy box, and the mother goes to
  open the toy box, but the boy says "No, do not open my toy box," and
  screams.  Mother is not allowed to open the toy box. Being extremely
  curious, and somewhat  ingenious, she invents a scheme! She knows that
  a block weighs three ounces,  so she weighs the box at a time when she
  sees 28 blocks, and it weighs 16 ounces.  The next time she wishes to
  check, she weighs the box again, subtracts sixteen  ounces and divides
  by three. She discovers the following: <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/LIGAT.jpg" alt="Equation 4.1"> There then
  appear to be some new deviations, but careful study indicates that the
  dirty water in the bathtub is changing its level. The child is
  throwing blocks into the water, and she cannot see them because it is
  so dirty, but she can find out how many blocks are in the water by
  adding another term to her formula. Since the original height of the
  water was 6 inches and each block raises the water a quarter of an
  inch, this new formula would be: <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/eX2pp.jpg" alt="Equation 4.2">
       In the gradual increase in the complexity of her world, she finds
  a whole series of terms representing ways of calculating how many
  blocks are in places where she is not allowed to look. As a result,
  she finds a complex formula, a quantity which has to be computed,
  which always stays the same in her situation.
       What is the analogy of this to the conservation of energy? <em>The
  most re- markable aspect that must be abstracted from this picture is
  that there are no blocks. Take away the first terms in (4.1) and (4.2)
  and we find ourselves calculating more or less abstract things.</em> The
  analogy has the following points. First, when we are calculating the
  energy, sometimes some of it leaves the system and goes away, or
  sometimes some comes in. In order to verify the conservation of
  energy, we must be careful that we have not put any in or taken any
  out. Second, the energy has a large number of different forms, and
  there is a formula for each one. These are: gravitational energy,
  kinetic energy, heat energy, elastic energy, electrical energy,
  chemical energy, radiant energy, nuclear energy, mass energy. If we
  total up the formulas for each of these contributions, it will not
  change except for energy going in and out.
       <strong>It is important to realize that in physics today, we have no
  knowledge of what energy is</strong>. We do not have a picture that energy
  comes in little blobs of a definite amount. It is not that way.
  However, there are formulas for calculating some numerical quantity,
  and when we add it all together it gives "28"'—always the same number.
  It is an abstract thing in that it does not tell us the mechanism or
  the reasons for the various formulas.</p>

	<span class="comment-copy">You are perfectly right. Energy (&#39;mass is energy&#39;) and force (as with magnetic or gravitational forces) concepts are &#39;magical&#39; stuff in physics; we use them, calculate them, predict them, without really understanding them but only with the illusion that we grasp them (as opposed with the deep understanding we have with the wind force which makes the sailing ship move). Anyway, in my opinion, your question, which is a good one, does not follow ideally from your argumentation.</span>

	<span class="comment-copy">If you start with Newton&#39;s laws, in particular the second law, F = ma, and the third law, every force has an equal and opposite reaction force, then it is possible to deduce that the quantity 0.5mv^2 is constant.  Therefore the conservation of this quantity, which we will arbitrarily call &quot;energy&quot;, is a fundamental property of the universe if it is true that F = ma, and that for every force there is an equal and opposite reaction force.  So kinetic energy is a quantity that is constant because of Newton&#39;s laws.  Newton&#39;s laws ultimately mean objects with high mass resist motion changes more.</span>

    <div class="post-text"><p>First of all, I would caution you against using definitions from Wikipedia when considering serious issues.  I'm not a physicist, but I'm sure that the appropriate people could give you pointers to places where serious physicists have weighed in on the proper definition of "energy" and "force."  (I seem to vaguely recall Feynman dealing with this in his lectures, but my memory is hazy, so don't trust me on that.)</p>

<p>But, since you are asking in a Philosophy forum and not a Physics forum, we can safely focus on the  properly philosophical aspects of your question.</p>

<p>To cut to the chase, Hume is canonical reference here, and you are quite correct that we only perceive effects, and not causes, and that there is no rigorous way for us to identify what we mean by a cause except circularly through reference to the effects.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this doesn't make much of a difference, since there is no need to believe in a cause at all, properly speaking.  You make a comparison to the statement "God is the cause due to which the universe exists"-- and that's a good analogy, because what we have here is simply a definition, not a proposition-- it adds no new knowledge.  It's like saying "A shape with 3 sides, we call a triangle."  The interesting (and challenging) thing comes when we wish to attribute more predicates to that definition.</p>

<p>In the case of "energy", we have very clear formulas that predict the effects of this occult cause, and the formulas work <em>regardless of whether you believe in the cause or not.</em>  It doesn't matter if "energy" as a force actually exists, as long as it is <strong>adequate to the phenomena.</strong></p>

<p>For me, the most useful way of framing this issue is via <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fictionalism/">Fictionalism</a>.  We can treat "energy" as a fictional entity, and continue to use "energy" as a provisionally useful concept, without making any ontological claims about "energy" whatsoever.</p>

<p>So, to summarize: the ontological existence of "energy" may be as poorly founded as the ontological existence of "god"; however, the explanation of the <em>effects</em> of energy are clearly adequate to the phenomena, and can be epistemologically justified with a great deal more certainty than can be brought to bear on most religious issues.  </p>

<p>If you can come up with a more parsimonious explanation for physical effects which does not require recourse to the concept of "energy", physicists will rejoice-- as long as the formulas still operate correctly.  I leave the religious analogy as an exercise to the reader.</p>

In maths if you do logic and analysis you would end up proving 1+1=2 (eventually), but that is long after you accepted that in primary school to even be able to start stduying maths. No it is not a circular thing, but something that you accept at a naive level and then work your way up to a solid level where you are able to question it, an look for basis for it.

    <div class="post-text"><p>"Energy is often understood as the ability a physical system has to do work on other physical systems."</p>

<p>"In physics, work is the amount of energy transferred by a force acting through a distance in the direction of the force."</p>

<p>"In physics, a force is any influence that causes a free body to undergo a change in speed, a change in direction, or a change in shape."</p>

<p>In other words: A body has energy which it can use to do work on another body, this body may transfer energy into another body to do work, and the other body is experiencing a force as a result of the previous body's work.</p>

<p>This doesn't seem to be a problem logically speaking.</p>

<p>What is force? Force is the result of work. That is it's the event of energy being put into a body to change it's state. </p>

<p>I will however concede to the point that some of Scientific claims are very much as baseless as any religious claim, or that religious hypotheses are rejected for some reason that could easily reject other scientific claims, But I do not think your examples are good ones.</p>

<p>If you intend to prove that some religious claims are just as good as a scientific claim, I would suggest that you look up falsifiability, which the institution of science seems to think is an excellent way to demarcate scientific thought from all else, and has become a criterion for any new hypothesis. Consider the concept of the indivisible unit that science has been concerned with since the dawn of time, String theory, and other sciences that don't have a method by which an observation can be made to find them false. These are somehow immune to this exception for no good reason...</p>

<p>It's something of a cyclic <em>definition</em> as given there.  One can do somewhat better, but you have exactly the same problem with language as a whole: it's necessarily cyclic, since you can't get started defining language without using it.  So this isn't a particularly worrying state of affairs as long as you know how to use energy, force, etc. in calculations and intuitive understanding.</p>

<p>The argument for the definitions being useful is the gigantic amount of evidence that formulae based upon these definitions give exquisitely accurate predictions.  Presumably you've noticed this in studying physics.</p>

<p>The logical structure of the endeavor is radically different than the logical structure of most religious practice and doctrine.</p>

What I meant to say was that the fundamental concepts are inferred from the <i>effects</i>, not by direct observation of the cause itself. Taking Newton&#39;s 3rd law for example, consider a rocket which is launched into space. The law implies that the rocket exerts force on the ground, the ground in turn exerts a force in the opposite direction thus sending the rocket skyward. But can you prove the existence of force independently without considering its effects?</span>

<li>The famous mathematicion David Hilbert, in his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_problems" rel="nofollow">list of problems</a> given at a conference in 1900, gave <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_sixth_problem" rel="nofollow">number 6</a> as, to oversimplify, axiomatize physics. So it was seen as something as possible to do and desired to do so.</li>
<li>one -can- define things circularly, and in some sense, that makes them equivalent, or at least only relatively supportable. So one could say that energy and work define each other, and however inchoate your conception of either of those concepts may be individually, together they are very well defined.</li>
<li>these concepts, like energy/work/force/pressure/volume/velocity/time/etc, come from centuries of teasing out (by experiment and thought) exactly what they mean. There is no guarantee of -the- final answer but certainly refinement. The one line summary of the concept really can't be expected to do the entire concept justice.</li>
<li>it is common to notice similarities between science and religion; they both rely on faith/authority, they both attempt to explain the world, etc. But the kind of faith /explanation/whatever is very different. Science -depends- on repeatable data and theoretical (one could make a case that religion does too but it is not necessary for religion). If an authority is invoked in science, it is expected that the statements of the authority can be checked by repeating an experiment or thought process (there is not faith in faith).</li>

    <div class="post-text"><p>I agree with the observation that the Wikipedia definitions (but really article introductions which is not quite a definition) are insufficient.  I've wrestled with these issues a good bit myself, and in trying to educate other people in physics.</p>

<p>I believe there is a notable missing piece here, which is <strong>geometry</strong>.  I find that people will very often question the philosophical basis of physics, but when I challenge them to question the philosophical basis of geometry, they don't even understand what I'm talking about.  In reality though, geometry was the fist in the progression of a scientific worldview.  Geometry is a perquisite for physics in the truest sense.  Now, let me echo something from a previous answer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To cut to the chase, Hume is canonical reference here, and you are quite correct that we only perceive effects, and not causes, and that there is no rigorous way for us to identify what we mean by a cause except circularly through reference to the effects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want to drive a little in the direction of perception, and the basis for believing that we have observed something.  It is apparent to most people that we live in a 3-dimensional world, as evidenced by their senses, but the idea of 3 dimensions is a geometric concept.  Geometry applies rules that demand consistency of statements regarding a real observed phenomena.  That real phenomena is the apparently 3-D (+time), apparently Euclidean space that we live in.</p>

<p>Basic Newtonian kinematics extends the tenants of geometry to motion of objects.  I think that a major roadblock here is the question of "<strong>what is our perception?</strong>"  If one fully accepts the tenants of geometry, then they can simply make a definition of perception that is the evolution of the geometric form of the world around them over time.  If you do that, Newtonian kinematics is not lacking anything in terms of physical justification because it is demonstrated to be very well reproducible.  Values such as <em>mass</em> and <em>energy</em> are not derivable from the basics of geometry although a value such as <em>volume</em> is.  These values that arise in the formulation of physics that were not present previously can be taken as nothing more than an intermediary - something introduced in order to maintain a consistent set of laws.</p>

<p>For this question, I think that what I've written is sufficient for the philosophical justification of physics with the assumptions I've mentioned (like acceptance of geometry), but I want to take a step back before concluding.  Our perception is not exactly that of 3-D Euclidean space + time.  From the moment we gain consciousness we find ourselves experiencing that geometry, but we only experience it indirectly, through other senses that are both:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lower dimensional</li>
<li>Imperfect</li>
</ul>

<p>Our vision may be 2D, but just like a computer screen, the smallest detail that can be represented is limited.  These days, we have a very good intuition due to computers that a higher dimensional concept can be mimicked by a lower dimensional source of information, provided that it is not represented in infinite detail.  I think this allows us to break off from the false notion of perception of the "obvious" world around us, and reduces the problem to that fact, the simple observation, that we have senses.  Beyond that, consistent laws can be formulated for what we see through those senses.  Physics, and more specifically the mechanics you re is merely one stage in that process.</p>

    <div class="post-text"><p>Feynman is making a particular point about the abstract nature and the ontological commitments we may or may not make in physics.</p>

<p>It is true that since the formulas work without caring about your ontological commitments one can dispense with foundational questions about energy in a rigourous manner. </p>

<p>However, physicists do not think quite like that. There is a story, probably apocrophol, when Pauli, a famous physicist saw von Neumann, a famous mathematician writing out yet another theorem on the blackboard. He said, 'Johnnie, if physics were theorems, you'd make a great physicist'.</p>

<p>The point of this story is that physicist uses what is called <em>physical intuition</em>, and this is learnt by learning how successful theories have been understood, motivated and modified over <em>centuries</em>, the kind of questions they purport to answer, and their own sense of the behaviour of reality. </p>

<p>Some examples: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Although Hilbert pretty much discovered Einsteins theory of General Relativity after hints from Einstein at about the same time that Einstein did; it was Einstein that got the credit because he gave the physical reasoning and not simply mathematical: he had suddenly understood the importance of why a man in free fall doesn't feel his own weight - his 'happy thought'. This actually was an old puzzle, why were there two definitions of mass - inertial &amp; gravitational, surely nature would be economical and have only one. Einstein proposed that they were in fact the one and same definition looked at from two different perspectives - his famous equivalence principle.</p></li>
<li><p>Heisenberg discovered his famous uncertainty principle by realising that a small enough system is always affected by the observations that we make on it. In older theories this was never a concern.</p></li>
<li><p>Hawking discovered Hawking Radiation after he realised he couldn't disprove Bekensteins claim that thermodynamics applied to black holes, and he discovered this by noting that their horizons can only increase which reminded him of the property of entropy which only increases too. </p></li>
<li><p>Lord Klein developed an alternative model of the atom as a knot. He couldn't get this to work and dropped it. Of course, the importance of this insight is that we are no longer considering an atom as a point particle but as a string. Much later, string theory exploded into the mainstream.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But to finally answer your question, yes, fundamental concepts do have a logical basis, but not the formal logicism of a foundationalist programme in mathematics that works from axioms, but a much more intricate relation of justifications, rationales and speculations - this is the form of its logic. </p>
