            <p> An article in <em><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/03/1491/2445/" rel="nofollow">the Atlantic</a></em> quotes several experts who claim that the Amazon rainforest is the remnants of planted and cultivated orchards and farms, and that the land is not naturally conducive to this type of growth.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> Planting their orchards, the first Amazonians transformed large swaths
  of the river basin into something more pleasing to human beings. In a
  widely cited article from 1989, William Balée, the Tulane
  anthropologist, cautiously estimated that about 12 percent of the
  nonflooded Amazon forest was of anthropogenic origin—directly or
  indirectly created by human beings. In some circles this is now seen
  as a conservative position. "I basically think it's all
  human-created," Clement told me in Brazil. He argues that Indians
  changed the assortment and density of species throughout the region.
  So does Clark Erickson, the University of Pennsylvania archaeologist,
  who told me in Bolivia that the lowland tropical forests of South
  America are among the finest works of art on the planet. "Some of my
  colleagues would say that's pretty radical," he said, smiling
  mischievously. According to Peter Stahl, an anthropologist at the
  State University of New York at Binghamton, "lots" of botanists
  believe that "what the eco-imagery would like to picture as a
  pristine, untouched Urwelt [primeval world] in fact has been managed
  by people for millennia." The phrase "built environment," Erickson
  says, "applies to most, if not all, Neotropical landscapes."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> Planting their orchards, the first Amazonians transformed large swaths
  of the river basin into something more pleasing to human beings. In a
  widely cited article from 1989, William Balée, the Tulane
  anthropologist, cautiously estimated that about 12 percent of the
  nonflooded Amazon forest was of anthropogenic origin—directly or
  indirectly created by human beings. In some circles this is now seen
  as a conservative position. "I basically think it's all
  human-created," Clement told me in Brazil. He argues that Indians
  changed the assortment and density of species throughout the region.
  So does Clark Erickson, the University of Pennsylvania archaeologist,
  who told me in Bolivia that the lowland tropical forests of South
  America are among the finest works of art on the planet. "Some of my
  colleagues would say that's pretty radical," he said, smiling
  mischievously. According to Peter Stahl, an anthropologist at the
  State University of New York at Binghamton, "lots" of botanists
  believe that "what the eco-imagery would like to picture as a
  pristine, untouched Urwelt [primeval world] in fact has been managed
  by people for millennia." The phrase "built environment," Erickson
  says, "applies to most, if not all, Neotropical landscapes."</p>

<p> Is there any evidence that supports this position?  </p>
