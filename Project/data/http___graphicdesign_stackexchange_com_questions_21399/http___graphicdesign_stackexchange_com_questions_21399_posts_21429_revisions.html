<ol>
<li> Things like Wordpress that come with some form of <strong>marketplace</strong> where
design elements like skins and themes can be sold</li>
<li> Things like Drupal where there isn't so much a marketplace as a <strong>demand for designers who have specific skills</strong> associated with that product</li>
<li> Things like the small army of people making SVG graphics for Wikipedia who are motivated by it being a <strong>specific cause they

<h2>How to get more involvement from designers?</h2>

<p> Keep in mind that the only one of your motivations that will be true for designers is more work to show - and this is easy to get. Designers will rarely meet talented designers through open source work - even in those exceptional cases like the world of Wordpress themes where there's some motivation and a few designers involved.</p>

<p> Even more important is making sure there are no obstacles to any designers you do manage to motivate from actually getting involved:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>How will they actually contribute?</strong> Regular designers aren't going to spend hours figuring out how GitHub works then hours more figuring out how the hell to make it a useful version control system for graphics. Links to documentation won't be enough here... If you haven't built something that works, they won't come.</li>
<li><strong>How is the work allocated?</strong> Open source works by dividing a big job between many people. It's great for debugging, but in design, that becomes design by committee and the final product can easily become an inconsistent mess that no individual who contributed to it will want in their portfolio, regardless of the abilities of each contributor. Clear style guidelines make a really big difference, as does a good community that has figured out how to do online critiques that a) work and b) don't deter members.</li>
<li><strong><span class="diff-add">Would the existing community even accommodate them?</span></strong> <span class="diff-add">There are a few times I've seen projects I support suffering through poor UI design and thought "I could help here", then I've taken one look at the kinds of inane debate in the community - which often amounts to "I don't care what's good UI practice or what the users say, I'm a big developer in this community and I like it done like X" - and I've thought life is too short. It's like the very worst parts of the day job, minus the money.
