            <p> This may be kind of unusual in that I am the child not the parent- but it is still extremely relevant to my parents. Me and my parents are considering home-school as an option, I understand there are a lot of questions like this that have already been answered  but I think this is being asked in a very  circumstance different and thus may have different answers. The key reason for me taking home-school classes would be that I can't find any other options that allow the pace or level of learning that I'm at. </p>

<p> I'm currently working my way through <em>The Handbook of Mathematical Logic</em> by John Barwise, a textbook in abstract algebra and category theory, and a graduate level textbook in theoretical physics. However my school is starting soon and I feel that in my case school is actually a massive detriment to my learning because it takes time away that I would be spending learning at a much more advanced level. So my question is in my case what are my chances of getting into college with a home-school degree, and in what ways can I improve my chances. In a way I think my chances will be higher (this site provides a good overview of why I think this (<a href="http://www.onlinecollege.org/2011/09/13/15-key-facts-about-homeschooled-kids-in-college/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlinecollege.org/2011/09/13/15-key-facts-about-homeschooled-kids-in-college/</a>), especially considering that I'm a senior and have a very low GPA (although I consistently get 4s on end of year tests) because I've tended to slack off at high-school since it felt so menial<span class="diff-add"> so I think that home-school could be advantageous because my GPA would not carry over</span>. </p>

<p> Two other things to consider: how will it increase chances if I get high ACT or SAT scores and how will it increase my chances if I use the extra time to submit a few papers at academic conferences, I've only presented at one so far but I think without public school in the way it would give me time to do more. You opinion would be appreciated because my parents want to really think through what's the best option for my future (as all good parents have a right to do) so any response would help them make a decision. Thank you in advance for your replies !       </p>

            <p> This may be kind of unusual in that I am the child not the parent- but it is still extremely relevant to my parents. Me and my parents are considering home-school as an option, I understand there are a lot of questions like this that have already been answered  but I think this is being asked in a very  circumstance different and thus may have different answers. The key reason for me taking home-school classes would be that I can't find any other options that allow the pace or level of learning that I'm at. </p>

<p> I'm currently working my way through <em>The Handbook of Mathematical Logic</em> by John Barwise, a textbook in abstract algebra and category theory, and a graduate level textbook in theoretical physics. However my school is starting soon and I feel that in my case school is actually a massive detriment to my learning because it takes time away that I would be spending learning at a much more advanced level. So my question is in my case what are my chances of getting into college with a home-school degree, and in what ways can I improve my chances. In a way I think my chances will be higher (this site provides a good overview of why I think this <span class="diff-add">(</span><a href="http://www.onlinecollege.org/2011/09/13/15-key-facts-about-homeschooled-kids-in-college/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlinecollege.org/2011/09/13/15-key-facts-about-homeschooled-kids-in-college/</a>), especially considering that I'm a senior and have a very low GPA (although I consistently get 4s on end of year tests) because I've tended to slack off at high-school since it felt so menial. </p>

<p> Two other things to consider: how will it increase chances if I get high ACT or SAT scores and how will it increase my chances if I use the extra time to submit a few papers at academic conferences, I've only presented at one so far but I think without public school in the way it would give me time to do more. You opinion would be appreciated because my parents want to really think through what's the best option for my future (as all good parents have a right to do) so any response would help them make a decision. Thank you in advance for your replies !       </p>
