            <p> As a proponent of Home-education and a former classroom educator and advisor, I'll advise that switching now is probably not the time (sorry).

<p> As already pointed out, it really depends on the specific college and as I understand it, College admissions offices are overcoming former prejudices against home-schooled kids and even seeking them out in some cases.  However, at this late point in the game, leaving the school setting you are in and have been in for 11 years, looks more like escapism than an improvement in your situation on paper.</p>

<p> Focus on over-coming the challenges you have faced in the past so that you can speak about how you over-came them and are a better student now in interviews and in a short-essay response to, "Is there anything else we should know about you when considering your application."</p>

<p><strong>Consider these alternatives:</strong></p>

<p> Will your school work with you to grant an "independent study" so you can work your way through <em>The Handbook of Mathematical Logic</em> under the supervision of a cool teacher there at the school.
