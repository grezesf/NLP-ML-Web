            <p> There are some circumstances in which it is a good idea. Chris W Rea has already mentioned the case where you expect your marginal tax rate to decrease. But there is also the case where lack of contributions might cause your marginal rate to increase.</p>

<p> Assume your income is $20,000 over the 46% threshold, and you normally contribute $20,000 to RRSP. However this year you have only been able to contribute $10,000. If you wait until next year and contribute<span class="diff-delete"> and</span><span class="diff-add"> an</span> extra $10,000 (making $30,000) the extra $10,000 will only bring 35% tax back. If you can borrow the money and make the contribution this year it will get 46% tax back. That makes the loan worth taking.</p>

<p> Making the contribution now can also get you a larger rebate this year<span class="diff-add">. You will have that money for twelve extra months and you can invest it</span>. That probably isn't enough to make it worthwhile alone, but it certainly makes the damage less.</p>

<p> However I would always recommend taking out an RRSP loan for as short a time as possible. My recommendation would always be to make the contribution as late in the period as possible, apply for your tax refund as soon as you can, and then pay off the loan with the refund. You shoulod be able to get away with having the loan only for a couple of months.</p>

<p> Making the contribution now can also get you a larger rebate this year. That probably isn't enough to make it worthwhile alone, but it certainly makes the damage less.</p>

<p> However I would always recommend taking out an RRSP loan for as short a time as possible. My recommendation would always be to make the contribution as late in the period as possible, apply for your tax refund as soon as you can, and then pay off the loan with the refund.

                <p> There are some circumstances in which it is a good idea.

But there is also the case where lack of contributions might cause your marginal rate to increase.</p>

<p> Assume your income is $20,000 over the 46% threshold, and you normally contribute $20,000 to RRSP. However this year you have only been able to contribute $10,000. If you wait until next year and contribute and extra $10,000 (making $30,000) the extra $10,000 will only bring 35% tax back. If you can borrow the money and make the contribution this year it will get 46% tax back. That makes the loan worth taking.</p>
