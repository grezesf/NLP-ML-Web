            <p> Going off a little on what others have mentioned, I have a couple of main criticisms:</p>

<ol>
<li> Manually minified -- it's really difficult to get an idea of what you're really trying to do here.  I understand that you don't trust minifiers, but the reason people use those instead of always just writing small code by hand is so that they (and other developers) can make sense of the code when they're working on it, and yet still provide an optimized version for production.</li>
<li> The use of <code>doc</code> as your shorthand -- general concerns about global variables aside, that's just a bad name for a library shortcut variable.  What if someone using your library needs a variable named <code>doc</code>, to represent something the user uploads (for example)?  Sure they can sort it all out using correct scoping rules, but it'd be too easy for them to forget about it, maybe put their own variable in the global namespace, and then either their code breaks or your library breaks.  If you create a namespace for your library, then you can isolate <code>doc</code> from the user's code, and you'll be fine.</li>
<li> Modifying existing object prototypes -- really, I could go either way on this.  I've used the Prototype library, which did a lot of that, and it was really nice.  I'm also aware that it can really confuse developers, and it can even cause problems.  It's generally frowned upon by most "best practices" lists I've seen, so while I wouldn't avoid it completely, I'd recommend using it gently when it makes more sense than creating a wrapper.  That's probably one of the bigger selling points jQuery offers -- it creates a wrapper object instead of working with the direct JS object prototypes, so code that's expecting the additional functionality can use it, and code that might somehow rely on the original implementation won't know the difference.</li>
</ol>

<p> I'd really like to see the code in a non-minified, at least somewhat commented/documented format -- especially <code>Element.prototype.$p</code>.  That function looks interesting, but I'm having a hard time following along with it as a one-liner with arguments simply named <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.  Especially the <code>for .. in</code> condition -- <code>a in b=a</code>?  I've never come across an assignment used like that before.  I'm not saying it's wrong by any means, and maybe it's really common and I just missed it in my journeys, but it doesn't seem very intuitive or easily understandable; that would definitely be worth a couple of comments explaining what it does.</p>

<p> Hope this helps -- or at least makes sense even if it doesn't.</p><span class="diff-delete">

            <p> Going off a little on what others have mentioned, I have a couple of main criticisms:</p>

<ol>
<li> Manually minified -- it's really difficult to get an idea of what you're really trying to do here.  I understand that you don't trust minifiers, but the reason people use those instead of always just writing small code by hand is so that they (and other developers) can make sense of the code when they're working on it, and yet still provide an optimized version for production.</li>
<li> The use of<span class="diff-delete"> "doc" as</span><span class="diff-add"> </span><code><span class="diff-add">doc</span></code> <span class="diff-add">as</span> your shorthand -- general concerns about global variables aside, that's just a bad name for a library shortcut variable.  What if someone using your library needs a variable named<span class="diff-delete"> "doc"</span><span class="diff-add"> </span><code><span class="diff-add">doc</span></code>, to represent something the user uploads (for example)?  Sure they can sort it all out using correct scoping rules, but it'd be too easy for them to forget about it, maybe put their own variable in the global namespace, and then either their code breaks or your library breaks.  If you create a namespace for your library, then you can isolate<span class="diff-delete"> doc from</span><span class="diff-add"> </span><code><span class="diff-add">doc</span></code> <span class="diff-add">from</span> the user's code, and you'll be fine.</li>
<li> Modifying existing object prototypes -- really, I could go either way on this.  I've used the Prototype library, which did a lot of that, and it was really nice.  I'm also aware that it can really confuse developers, and it can even cause problems.  It's generally frowned upon by most "best practices" lists I've seen, so while I wouldn't avoid it completely, I'd recommend using it gently when it makes more sense than creating a wrapper.  That's probably one of the bigger selling points jQuery offers -- it creates a wrapper object instead of working with the direct JS object prototypes, so code that's expecting the additional functionality can use it, and code that might somehow rely on the original implementation won't know the difference.</li>
</ol>

<p> I'd really like to see the code in a non-minified, at least somewhat commented/documented format -- especially<span class="diff-delete"> Element.prototype.$p</span><span class="diff-add"> </span><code><span class="diff-add">Element.prototype.$p</span></code>.  That function looks interesting, but I'm having a hard time following along with it as a one-liner with arguments simply named<span class="diff-delete"> "a" and "b"</span><span class="diff-add"> </span><code><span class="diff-add">a</span></code> <span class="diff-add">and </span><code><span class="diff-add">b</span></code>.  Especially the<span class="diff-delete"> for</span> <span class="diff-delete">.. in condition</span><code><span class="diff-add">for .. in</span></code> <span class="diff-add">condition</span> --<span class="diff-delete"> "a in b=a"</span><span class="diff-add"> </span><code><span class="diff-add">a in b=a</span></code>?  I've never come across an assignment used like that before.  I'm not saying it's wrong by any means, and maybe it's really common and I just missed it in my journeys, but it doesn't seem very intuitive or easily understandable; that would definitely be worth a couple of comments explaining what it does.</p>

<p> Hope this helps -- or at least makes sense even if it doesn't.</p>
