            <p> In the days and weeks before a moderator election, the community applies great scrutiny to all candidates. They need to jump through a series of hoops, answer hard questions in the town hall meetings, and have to convince the audience of their good character and judgement - almost like in a real-world election for a seat on the city council, or a judge's post!</p>

<p> After the election, however, we seem to forget about them unless they do something scandalous. In general, that is a good thing and by design - the basis of Stack Overflow's moderation is being an invisible hand in the background, so most of the moderators' activity will go unnoticed.</p>

<p> Still - once they quit the post, there is not much left to thank them for their service. For example, Gumbo and SLaks withdrew from the post <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/113294/november-2011-community-moderator-election-results">before last election</a>, and received little in terms of thanks from the community.

<li><p> A programming-related perk (no money) bought wholesale by SO, like a subscription to a magazine, paid video training, a book of their choice from a  publisher's range, access to stuff like those paid MSDN thingies...</p></li>

            <p> In the days and weeks before a moderator election, the community applies great scrutiny to all candidates. They need to jump through a series of hoops, answer hard questions in the town hall meetings, and have to convince the audience of their good character and judgement - almost like in a real-world election for a seat on the city council, or a judge's post!</p>

<p> After the election, however, we seem to forget about them unless they do something scandalous. In general, that is a good thing and by design - the basis of Stack Overflow's moderation is being an invisible hand in the background, so most of the moderators' activity will go unnoticed.</p>

<p> Still - once they quit the post, there is not much left to thank them for their service. For example, Gumbo and SLaks withdrew from the post <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/113294/november-2011-community-moderator-election-results">before last election</a>, and received little in terms of thanks from the community. That's not meant as criticism - I, too, read the post, and somehow didn't feel like adding my thanks, either - for whatever reason, I don't really remember.
.  But  it <em>is</em> a little bit unceremonious and not really reflecting the work they put in to keep the sites clean - and I'm <em>sure</em> being a mod is much, much more like work than it is to just be  a power user. As a mod, you are expected to show up frequently, and process <em>some</em> amount of flags.</p>

<p> I think after a year of service with a good track record, moderators should get <em>something</em> nice and special. Inviting every mod to New York City would probably break the company's budget twice, but there are smaller ideas that might also be nice:</p>

<ul>
<li><p> At the very least, a gold badge.</p></li>
<li><p> Some official confirmation in the profile of being an ex-moderator for CV purposes (if desired)</p></li>
<li><p><strike>A donation from SO, Inc. at year's end to a registered charity of the moderator's choice, in the name of the moderator</strike> (<strong>Edit:</strong> As pointed out by Michael Mrozek, moderators already <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/12/stack-overflow-gives-back/">get to decide</a> which charities SE's annual donations go to.)</p></li>

<li><p><strike><span class="diff-add">A donation from SO, Inc. at year's end to a registered charity of the moderator's choice, in the name of the moderator</span></strike> (<strong>Edit:</strong> As pointed out by Michael Mrozek, moderators already <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/12/stack-overflow-gives-back/">get to decide</a> which charities SE's annual donations go to.)</p></li>
<li><p> A programming-related perk (no money) bought wholesale by SO, like a subscription to a magazine, paid video training, a book of their choice from a  publisher's range, access to stuff like those paid MSDN thingies...</p></li>

<p> What do people think? Am I alone in seeing things this way? I'm not a moderator so I don't know<span class="diff-add"> for sure</span> of course. </p>
