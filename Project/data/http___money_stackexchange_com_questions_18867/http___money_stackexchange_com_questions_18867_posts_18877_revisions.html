A bank virtually never offers<span class="diff-delete"> a</span><span class="diff-add"> an unsecured</span> "signature loan" for a house<span class="diff-add"> (certainly not at the advertised 3-4% interest rates)</span>. They want something to back up the loan, so if you disappear off the face of the earth they have a clear claim to something that can help them recover their money. Usually, that's the house itself; if you default, they get the house from you and sell it to recover their money.</p><p> Now, a major cause of foreclosure is economic downturn, like the one we had in 2009 and are still recovering from. When the economy goes in the crapper, a lot of things we generally consider "stores of value" lose that value, because the value of the whatzit (any whatzit, really) is based on what someone else would pay to have<span class="diff-add"> it. When fewer people are looking to buy that whatzit, demand drops, bringing prices with</span> it. Homes and real estate are one of the<span class="diff-add"> real</span> big<span class="diff-delete"> things</span><span class="diff-add">-ticket items</span> subject to<span class="diff-delete"> this;</span><span class="diff-add"> this loss of value;</span> when the average Joe doesn't know whether he'll have a job tomorrow, he doesn't go house-hunting<span class="diff-delete">, and that drives down demand, which in turn drives down home values</span>. This average Joe may even be looking to sell an extra parcel of land or an income property for cash, increasing supply, further decreasing prices. Economic downturn can often increase crime and decrease local government spending on upkeep of public lands (as well as homeowners' upkeep of their own property). By the "broken window" effect, this makes the neighborhood even less desirable in a vicious cycle.</p><p> What made this current recession a double-whammy for mortgage lenders is that it was caused, in large part, by a housing bubble; cheap money for houses made housing prices balloon<span class="diff-add"> rapidly</span>, and then when the money became more expensive (such as in sub-prime ARMs), a lot of those loans, which should never have been signed off on by either side, went belly-up. Between the loss of home value (a lot of which will likely turn out to be permanent; that's the problem with a bubble, things never recover to their peak) and the adjustment of interest rates on mortgages to terms that will actually pay off the loan, many homeowners found themselves so far underwater (and sinking fast) that the best financial move for them was to walk away from the whole thing and try again in seven years.</p><p> Now the bank's in a quandary. They have this loan they'll never see repaid in cash, and they have this home that's worth maybe 75% of the mortgage's outstanding balance (if they're lucky; some homes in extremely "distressed" areas like Detroit are currently trading for 30-40% of what they sold for just before the bubble burst)<span class="diff-add">. Multiply that by, say, 100,000 distressed homes with similar declines in value, and you're talking about tens of billions of dollars in losses</span>. On top of that, the guarantor (basically the bank's insurance company<span class="diff-add"> against these types of losses</span>)<span class="diff-delete"> that said they'd cover any "gap" in this scenario</span> is now in financial trouble themselves<span class="diff-add">, because they took on so many contracts for debt that turned out to be bad</span> (AIG, Fannie/Freddie)<span class="diff-delete">, and/or</span><span class="diff-add">; they</span> may<span class="diff-delete"> be requiring</span><span class="diff-add"> very well declare bankruptcy and leave</span> the bank<span class="diff-add"> holding the bag. Even if the guarantor remains solvent (as they did thanks to generous taxpayer bailouts), the bank's swap contract with the guarantor usually requires them</span> to sell the house, thus realizing the loss<span class="diff-add"> between what they paid and what they finally got back</span>, before<span class="diff-delete"> they'll cover</span> the<span class="diff-delete"> difference</span><span class="diff-add"> guarantor will pay out</span>.<span class="diff-delete"> &nbsp;</span></p><p> But<span class="diff-delete"> how do you sell a house when</span> nobody's buying<span class="diff-delete">? You make them an offer they can't refuse</span><span class="diff-add"> houses anymore</span>,<span class="diff-delete"> that's how;</span><span class="diff-add"> because prices are on their way down; the only people who'd buy a house now versus a year from now (or two or three years) are the people who have no choice, and if</span> you<span class="diff-add"> have no choice you're probably in a financial situation that would mean you'd never be approved for the loan anyway. In order to get rid of them, the bank has to</span> sell<span class="diff-delete"> it</span><span class="diff-add"> them</span> at auction for pennies on the dollar<span class="diff-delete"> (or at least another 10-20% below current real market value)</span>. That further<span class="diff-delete"> depresses</span><span class="diff-add"> increases the supply of cheap homes and further drives down</span> prices,<span class="diff-delete"> further increases what</span><span class="diff-add"> making even</span> the<span class="diff-delete"> guarantors have</span><span class="diff-add"> nicer homes the bank's willing</span> to<span class="diff-delete"> cough up putting</span><span class="diff-add"> keep on the books worth less (there's a reason these distresed homes were called "toxic assets"; they're poisonous to the banks whether they keep or sell</span> them<span class="diff-delete"> in even direr straits</span><span class="diff-add">).</span></p><p><span class="diff-add"> Meanwhile</span>,<span class="diff-delete"> and eventually</span><span class="diff-add"> all this price depression is now affecting the</span> people who<span class="diff-delete"> have done</span><span class="diff-add"> did</span> everything<span class="diff-delete"> "right"</span><span class="diff-add"> right; even people who bought their homes years before the bubble even formed</span> are<span class="diff-delete"> now</span><span class="diff-add"> watching years of equity-building go down the crapper. That's to say nothing of the people with prime credit who bought at just the wrong time, when the bubble was at its peak. Even without an adjusting ARM to contend with, these guys are still facing the fact that they paid top dollar for a house that likely will not be worth its purchase price again in their lifetime. Even with a fixed mortgage rate, they'll be</span> underwater<span class="diff-delete"> and considering walking</span><span class="diff-add">, effectively losing their entire payment to the bank as if it were rent, for much longer than it would take to have this entire mess completely behind them if they just walked</span> away from<span class="diff-delete"> their homes</span><span class="diff-add"> the whole thing, moved back into an apartment and waited it out</span>.<span class="diff-add"> So, these guys decide on a "strategic default"; give the bank the house</span> <span class="diff-add">(which doesn't cover the outstanding balance of course) and if they sue, file bankruptcy.</span></p><p> That <em>really</em> makes the banks nervous; if people who did everything right are considering the hell of foreclosure<span class="diff-add"> and bankruptcy</span> to be preferable to their current state of affairs, the bank's main threat keeping people in their homes is hollow.<span class="diff-delete"> They also don't know who to trust, making</span><span class="diff-add"> That makes</span> them very reluctant to sign new mortgages<span class="diff-add">, because the risk of default is now much less certain</span>.

When the economy goes in the crapper, a lot of things we generally consider "stores of value" lose that value, because the value of the whatzit (any whatzit, really) is based on what someone else would pay to have<span class="diff-add"> it. When fewer people are looking to buy that whatzit, demand drops, bringing prices with</span> it. Homes and real estate are one of the<span class="diff-add"> real</span> big<span class="diff-add">-ticket items</span> subject to<span class="diff-add"> this loss of value;</span> when the average Joe doesn't know whether he'll have a job tomorrow, he doesn't go house-hunting. This average Joe may even be looking to sell an extra parcel of land or an income property for cash, increasing supply, further decreasing prices. Economic downturn can often increase crime and decrease local government spending on upkeep of public lands (as well as homeowners' upkeep of their own property). By the "broken window" effect, this makes the neighborhood even less desirable in a vicious cycle.</p><p> What made this current recession a double-whammy for mortgage lenders is that it was caused, in large part, by a housing bubble; cheap money for houses made housing prices balloon<span class="diff-add"> rapidly</span>, and then when the money became more expensive (such as in sub-prime ARMs), a lot of those loans, which should never have been signed off on by either side, went belly-up. Between the loss of home value (a lot of which will likely turn out to be permanent; that's the problem with a bubble, things never recover to their peak) and the adjustment of interest rates on mortgages to terms that will actually pay off the loan, many homeowners found themselves so far underwater (and sinking fast) that the best financial move for them was to walk away from the whole thing and try again in seven years.</p><p> Now the bank's in a quandary. They have this loan they'll never see repaid in cash, and they have this home that's worth maybe 75% of the mortgage's outstanding balance (if they're lucky; some homes in extremely "distressed" areas like Detroit are currently trading for 30-40% of what they sold for just before the bubble burst)<span class="diff-add">. Multiply that by, say, 100,000 distressed homes with similar declines in value, and you're talking about tens of billions of dollars in losses</span>. On top of that, the guarantor (basically the bank's insurance company<span class="diff-add"> against these types of losses</span>) is now in financial trouble themselves<span class="diff-add">, because they took on so many contracts for debt that turned out to be bad</span> (AIG, Fannie/Freddie)<span class="diff-add">; they</span> may<span class="diff-add"> very well declare bankruptcy and leave</span> the bank<span class="diff-add"> holding the bag. Even if the guarantor remains solvent (as they did thanks to generous taxpayer bailouts), the bank's swap contract with the guarantor usually requires them</span> to sell the house, thus realizing the loss<span class="diff-add"> between what they paid and what they finally got back</span>, before the<span class="diff-add"> guarantor will pay out</span>.</p><p> But nobody's buying<span class="diff-add"> houses anymore</span>,<span class="diff-add"> because prices are on their way down; the only people who'd buy a house now versus a year from now (or two or three years) are the people who have no choice, and if</span> you<span class="diff-add"> have no choice you're probably in a financial situation that would mean you'd never be approved for the loan anyway. In order to get rid of them, the bank has to</span> sell<span class="diff-add"> them</span> at auction for pennies on the dollar. That further<span class="diff-add"> increases the supply of cheap homes and further drives down</span> prices,<span class="diff-add"> making even</span> the<span class="diff-add"> nicer homes the bank's willing</span> to<span class="diff-add"> keep on the books worth less (there's a reason these distresed homes were called "toxic assets"; they're poisonous to the banks whether they keep or sell</span> them<span class="diff-add">).</span></p><p><span class="diff-add"> Meanwhile</span>,<span class="diff-add"> all this price depression is now affecting the</span> people who<span class="diff-add"> did</span> everything<span class="diff-add"> right; even people who bought their homes years before the bubble even formed</span> are<span class="diff-add"> watching years of equity-building go down the crapper. That's to say nothing of the people with prime credit who bought at just the wrong time, when the bubble was at its peak. Even without an adjusting ARM to contend with, these guys are still facing the fact that they paid top dollar for a house that likely will not be worth its purchase price again in their lifetime. Even with a fixed mortgage rate, they'll be</span> underwater<span class="diff-add">, effectively losing their entire payment to the bank as if it were rent, for much longer than it would take to have this entire mess completely behind them if they just walked</span> away from<span class="diff-add"> the whole thing, moved back into an apartment and waited it out</span>.<span class="diff-add"> So, these guys decide on a "strategic default"; give the bank the house</span> <span class="diff-add">(which doesn't cover the outstanding balance of course) and if they sue, file bankruptcy.</span></p><p> That <em>really</em> makes the banks nervous; if people who did everything right are considering the hell of foreclosure<span class="diff-add"> and bankruptcy</span> to be preferable to their current state of affairs, the bank's main threat keeping people in their homes is hollow.<span class="diff-add"> That makes</span> them very reluctant to sign new mortgages<span class="diff-add">, because the risk of default is now much less certain</span>. Now people who <em>do</em> want houses in this market can't buy them, further reducing demand, further decreasing prices...</p><div class="diff-skipped"><div></div></div>
