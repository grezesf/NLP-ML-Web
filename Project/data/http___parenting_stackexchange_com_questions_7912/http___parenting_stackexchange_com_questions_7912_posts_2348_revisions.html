            <p><strong>Night drive</strong></p>

<p> The first idea that comes to my mind is driving at night. Our son often falls asleep in the car, most likely because of the movements and the white noise. </p>

<p> Prepare and pack the car during the day or early evening. Make sure you're well rested on this day. Do a shorter version of your bedtime routine, and do it earlier than usual, then get in the car and start driving. He'll fall asleep soon enough.</p>

<p> Both parents can take turns driving and sleeping, and you could also plan a short (&lt;20 minutes) power nap around midnight to keep fresh, possibly with some <a href="http://torben.g-b.dk/pzizz" rel="nofollow">booster music</a>. The important thing is to take a break <em>before</em> you get really tired.</p>

<p><strong>Drawbacks?</strong>  </p>

<p> Most obvious is that you'll both be kind of tired the following day.<br>
<em>-Solution:</em> Since you're visiting your family, perhaps they can lend a hand with attending to your son. </p>

<p> You might also be tired during the drive, as I've already stated.<br>
<em>-Solution:</em> Start out well rested.<span class="diff-add"> Take breaks early.</span> Consume enough fluids and proper(!) food to keep you going<span class="diff-delete">. Take breaks early</span>.<br>
<em>-Booster music:</em> That booster music is something I actually use, and despite appearances it really, honestly works! It works best if you're familiar with it in advance, so some "training" (conditioning, really) helps. Must be used with headphones, and in-ear headphones are better than old-school ("walkman") on-ear headphones.</p>

<p> It's also worth noting that some people are more comfortable driving in daylight, for various reasons. I personally prefer the night, as long as the roads are in decent condition and I know my way around (I wouldn't like to weave through unfamiliar, worn and narrow Italian streets at night).<br>
