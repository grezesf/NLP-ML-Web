            <p><strong>Talk to the players</strong></p>

<p> Others have said it, but this can't be over emphasized.  Most traditional RPGs are collaborative affairs and the GM cannot be responsible for making everyone happy.  So talk to them plainly and see what they want.  They may be highly supportive of ending this campaign and starting a new one or of working with you to change the direction of the game or any number of other options that you can all partake in as a team.</p>

<p><strong>Railroading is not an either/or</strong></p>

<p> You mention that you hate railroading, which I totally understand.  But realize that most campaigns will not be and should not be "railroading or open world".  It is much more of a spectrum of "some railroading and some open world, but with varying amounts".  And the amount can vary not just between games but within one campaign.  It may be helpful to railroad fairly heavily at the beginning of a campaign as you get the world established, get the characters fully established and grounded, and get some of the potential plots established.  Then you can ease up and move more open world when all of the characters have motivations well established and plot hooks sunk deep.</p>

<p><strong>Evil can mean a lot of things</strong></p>

<p> You said that most of the characters ended up evil, but that can  mean a lot of things.  An evil character that just wants to make the world burn (probably) isn't well developed or interesting as anything but an excuse for Hero to get into fights.  </p>

<p> However, an evil character with a backstory for why they are evil and a specific motivation can be very interesting, sympathetic, and even hold onto a code of honor<span class="diff-delete"> will</span><span class="diff-add"> while</span> definitely being evil.  Shylock is (<span class="diff-delete">generally</span><span class="diff-add">often</span>, there are multiple interpetations) portrayed as evil and greedy, but also in a sympathetic and relatable way and gets one of the most eloquent speeches Shakespeare ever wrote.

<p> You mention that you hate railroading, which I totally understand.  But realize that most campaigns will not be and should not be "railroading or open world".  It is much more of a spectrum of "some railroading and some open world, but with varying amounts".  And the amount can vary not just between games but within one campaign.  It may be helpful to railroad fairly heavily at the beginning of a campaign as you get the world established, get the characters fully established and grounded, and get some of the potential plots established.
