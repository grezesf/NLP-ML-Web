            <p> I'll begin with a few general remarks. I might suggest one way to look at this is to think about language. In order to become a fluent speaker in the language, you really need to be immersed. Why? Because <em>just knowing the rules themselves really doesn't tell you as much as you might think.</em> </p>

<p> Rules demand meta-rules, in a potentially infinite regress: where to apply them? How strictly? How will we know if our application has been effective? And so on. In other words, for every written rule, there are a number of unwritten errata; and further unwritten codices for when and how to apply it. </p>

<p> At an even higher level of abstractions we can consider heuristics -- strategies suitable for broad classes of problems, which don't even specify an explicit set of rules but rather offer a kind of recipe, or more or less formal 'story' or 'theory' about the solution process.</p>

<p> I might suggest that human beings are generally fairly adept at navigating among these 'clouds' of meta-law around the explicit framework and the general guidelines or heuristics describing ways of using the framework to resolve questions, because we are trained to do it. </p>

<p> We have to learn all of this; and our teachers have to be patient with us as we learn. We are gradually 'subjectivized' into ever more complex and abstract rule-dominated processes. They are linked strongly to judicial as well as disciplinary institutions.</p>

<p> Wittgenstein himself seems to indicate that rule-following is a <em>praxis</em>, though perhaps not an unparadoxical one -- from the selection you asked after:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...[T]o think one is obeying a rule is not to obey a rule. Hence it is not possible to obey a rule 'privately': otherwise thinking one was obeying a rule would be the same thing as obeying it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> I happen to think this is pretty interesting and definitely agree there is something to this. Zizek might perhaps suggest that there is a kind of terrifying excess when one really 'follows' the rules, without respecting the various meta-rules which make them workable.</p>

<p> In passing, I am reminded of Deleuze at the beginning of <em>Difference and Repetition</em>, who talks about the two ways of overturning the law: either with irony, by challenging the law as itself secondary or derived; or on the other hand, through humor -- by<span class="diff-delete"> following the law</span><span class="diff-add"> offering submission in a "too perfect" way</span> so<span class="diff-delete"> obtusely</span><span class="diff-add"> that</span> you effectively evade it. From there:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> There are two known ways to overturn moral law. One is by ascending towards the principles: challenging a law as secondary, derived, borrowed or 'general'; denouncing it as involving a second-hand principle which diverts an original force or usurps an original power. The other way, by contrast, is to overturn the law by descending towards the consequences, to which one submits with a too-perfect attention to detail. By adopting the law, a falsely submissive soul manages to evade it and to taste pleasures it was supposed to forbid. We can see this in demonstration by absurdity and working to rule, but also in some forms of masochistic behaviour which mock by submission... (Gilles Deleuze, <em>Difference and Repetition</em> [p. 6 in the Continuum 2004 edition])</p>

            <p> I'll begin with a few general remarks. I might suggest one way to look at this is to think about language. In order to become a fluent speaker in the language, you really need to be immersed. Why? Because <em>just knowing the rules themselves really doesn't tell you as much as you might think.</em> </p>

<p> Rules demand meta-rules, in a potentially infinite regress: where to apply them? How strictly? How will we know if our application has been effective? And so on. In other words, for every written rule, there are a number of unwritten errata; and further unwritten codices for when and how to apply it. </p>

<p> At an even higher level of abstractions we can consider heuristics -- strategies suitable for broad classes of problems, which don't even specify an explicit set of rules but rather offer a kind of recipe, or more or less formal 'story' or 'theory' about the solution process.</p>

<p> I might suggest that human beings are generally fairly adept at navigating among these 'clouds' of meta-law around the explicit framework and the general guidelines or heuristics describing ways of using the framework to resolve questions, because we are trained to do it. </p>

<p> We have to learn all of this; and our teachers have to be patient with us as we learn. We are gradually 'subjectivized' into ever more complex and abstract rule-dominated processes. They are linked strongly to judicial as well as disciplinary institutions.</p>

<p> Wittgenstein himself seems to indicate that rule-following is a <em>praxis</em>, though perhaps not an unparadoxical one -- from the selection you asked after:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...[T]o think one is obeying a rule is not to obey a rule. Hence it is not possible to obey a rule 'privately': otherwise thinking one was obeying a rule would be the same thing as obeying it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> I happen to think this is pretty interesting and definitely agree there is something to this. Zizek might perhaps suggest that there is a kind of terrifying excess when one really 'follows' the rules, without respecting the various meta-rules which make them workable.</p>

<p> In passing, I am reminded of Deleuze at the beginning of <em>Difference and Repetition</em>, who talks about the two ways of overturning the law: either<span class="diff-delete"> ironically</span><span class="diff-add"> with irony</span>, by challenging the law as itself secondary or derived; or on the other hand, through humor -- by following the law so obtusely you effectively evade it. From there:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> There are two known ways to overturn moral law. One is by ascending towards the principles: challenging a law as secondary, derived, borrowed or 'general'; denouncing it as involving a second-hand principle which diverts an original force or usurps an original power. The other way, by contrast, is to overturn the law by descending towards the consequences, to which one submits with a too-perfect attention to detail. By adopting the law, a falsely submissive soul manages to evade it and to taste pleasures it was supposed to forbid.
