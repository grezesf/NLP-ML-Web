            <p><strong><span class="diff-delete">EDIT</span><em><strong></em><span class="diff-add">**EDIT**</span></strong> The answer to your question is almost 100% no. As I have explained in the comments and this answer it would be an extremely rare set of circumstances by which the scenario you describe would come to pass.<span class="diff-delete">
</span><strong><span class="diff-delete">ENDEDIT</span></strong><span class="diff-add"> Sovereign countries are just that, sovereign. There is the rule of sovereign immunity and the only way that your scenario can possibly work is if the other country consented to the lawsuit, which they wouldn't.</span></p>

<p><span class="diff-delete"> Trade</span><strong><span class="diff-add">Original Answer</span></strong><span class="diff-add">
Trade</span> agreements and treaties between countries are in fact the law in each respective country. There are obviously some exceptions, but that is the general rule. The most recent example I can think of is the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, also known as the CISG. The CISG seeks to bind parties (in different signatory states to the treaty) to common contract law practices.</p>

<p> So say for example you have Company A in Indiana, United States, and Company B in Alberta, Canada. They enter into a contract and state in the contract that they wish disputes to only be governed by the laws of Indiana, United States. Then a lawsuit ensues and the two companies think that only Indiana, United States law would apply, but that is not true. The CISG is the law of the land in the United States and in Canada. Specifically, in the United States Article VI, clause 2, of the Constitution states:</p>

<p> "This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding."</p>

<p> So in answer to your<span class="diff-add"> question</span> the answer would be no. A state would not need to sue another country in that country's court system to make it abide by the law of the treaty because it already is the law in that other country.</p>

<p> As far as I know the International Court of Justice, like apoorv020 said, is the only place that it makes sense for one sovereign state to sue another sovereign state. One of the most famous cases along these lines is: 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua_v._United_States" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua_v._United_States</a></p>

<p> Additionally, from a jurisdiction standpoint<span class="diff-delete"> you</span><span class="diff-add"> the US</span> would have<span class="diff-delete"> an absolute nightmare showing that jurisdiction was proper where say France is trying</span> to<span class="diff-delete"> show it has the right</span><span class="diff-add"> consent</span> to<span class="diff-delete"> sue in the United States</span><span class="diff-add"> being sued by France</span> over some cause of action<span class="diff-add"> in US court</span>.<span class="diff-add">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p> So in answer to your the answer would be no. A state would not need to sue another country in that country's court system to make it abide by the law of the treaty because it already is the law in that other country.</p>

<p> As far as I know the International Court of Justice, like apoorv020 said, is the only place that it makes sense for one sovereign state to sue another sovereign state. One of the most famous cases along these lines is: 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua_v._United_States" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua_v._United_States</a></p>

<p> Additionally, from a jurisdiction standpoint you would have an absolute nightmare showing that jurisdiction was proper where say France is trying to show it has the right to sue in the United States over some cause of action.</p>

                <p><strong><span class="diff-add">EDIT</span></strong> <span class="diff-add">The answer to your question is almost 100% no. As I have explained in the comments and this answer it would be an extremely rare set of circumstances by which the scenario you describe would come to pass.
</span><strong><span class="diff-add">ENDEDIT</span></strong></p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p> Trade agreements and treaties between countries are in fact the law in each respective country. There are obviously some exceptions, but that is the general rule. The most recent example I can think of is the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, also known as the CISG. The CISG seeks to bind parties (in different signatory states to the treaty) to common contract law practices.</p>

<p> So say for example you have Company A in Indiana, United States, and Company B in Alberta, Canada. They enter into a contract and state in the contract that they wish disputes to only be governed by the laws of Indiana, United States. Then a lawsuit ensues and the two companies think that only Indiana, United States law would apply, but that is not true. The CISG is the law of the land in the United States and in Canada. Specifically, in the United States Article VI, clause 2, of the Constitution states:</p>

<p> "This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding."</p>

<p> So in answer to your the answer would be no. A state would not need to sue another country in that country's court system to make it abide by the law of the treaty because it already is the law in that other country.</p>
