This can save a lot of time getting back to the business at hand.  Please bear in mind as well that if the original application is poorly written, then the code that results from an automatic migration might not be idea.

        <h1></h1>

        <div class="post-text">
            <p>First, I should say that I work for ArtinSoft, so my opinion here is based on what I’ve seen with our customers. However, my software development experiences prior to ArtinSoft extend further back than a decade and are quite relevant to the topic at hand.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Have I been in this position?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, absolutely and on many occasions.  Very seldom have I seen a company approach this hurdle proactively. More often than not, I've seen companies and their software applications languish with unsupported technologies that waited too late until the quick sands of technical obsolescence left them few or no choices. And in more than one instance, some have even got themselves in a position where only a complete rewrite will save them. That's not where you want to be. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do you sell it to your customers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would be honest with your customers... you want to continue to offer a superior product and be able respond quickly to their needs as the product evolves. The current VB6 environment is making that more and more difficult. It's tougher and tougher to find either talented VB6 developers or talented .Net developers that will tolerate VB6. And even if you do, that talent is going to get more and more expensive as the talent pool diminishes and job satisfaction dwindles.</p>

<p>Your customers use other applications in the normal course of their lives and eventually they are going to notice that your application is growing old and outdated and no longer meets the same expectations of that other day-to-day does.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do you sell this to your boss?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since I'm not sure of the exact situation that you find yourself in, here are the opportunities that I've contemplated most when considering make such transitions in the past. And you might want to find business and technical leaders within your company to help champion the effort and to help figure out the most appropriate way to sell this in your organization.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Competitive advantages / customer perception
I assume that your application is not alone in the car dealership software universe. If yours is the first one to make the great stride forward to .Net, then great. But if it's the last... is that really where your company want to be? Is it something that might prevent a customer from renewing their maintenance agreement - assuming you bring in revenue in that way? If you do, then what would be a better way to prove the value of a maintenance agreement than to upgrade the application? </p></li>
<li><p>Talent pool and retention
I'm not sure if you've experienced this phenomenon yet or how your technical workforce is structured but older technologies become more and more expensive, yield less and less innovation and make attracting and retaining talent increasingly difficult to the point where morale can be seriously affected. At this point, .Net talent is very affordable and available. It's still fun, still hip and has a long and valuable career potential for those that work with it. </p></li>
<li><p>New features and third-party components
I'm guessing that you guys continue to roll out new features? And I’m guessing that you may have noticed that there is less and less code samples available online in VB6. There are less people responding to the VB6 forums... unless of course it's in relation to .Net.  There are less support for VB6 third-party components and open-source projects.  Visual Studio for .Net is a vast improvement over the VB6 versions.  And the .Net language and native libraries may just render some of the third-party components in your application unnecessary. </p></li>
<li><p>Bug fixing and performance improvements
The tools for performance profiling in .Net are breath taking compared to what was previously available with VB6. Managed code is simply easier for people to work with. Debugging in Visual Studio for .Net is amazingly efficient. And sure, lots of improvements with connectivity, exception handling and memory management to mention only a few.</p></li>
<li><p>Creates new value.
When all is said and done, do you think that having a .Net application versus a Visual Basic 6 application will increase the valuation of your company? Private or publicly held, no matter - your application's value becomes a serious asset. If accounted for correctly, all of the development costs could be amortized over time as a capital investment. I'm no tax guy but I know that it can really change the equation.</p></li>
<li><p>Roadmap
Getting to .Net is a fantastic place to be since steps either in the direction of Silverlight and/or moving to the Cloud are so much closer a reality that it really opens up opportunity. In fact, have you considered such a move? The business cases for that can be mind-blowing. It's a real paradigm shift that can reduce cost tremendously and take your software to places that your competition could only dream off. Anyhow... I'm getting off topic without knowing more about your software and your business model.</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of the tools available to smooth the transition, which ones work and which should be avoided?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except for small applications, I would strongly recommend against a rewrite. Sure, who wouldn't like an opportunity to refactor. But the objective which can often times get lost in such a migration is just that... to migrate. Refactor and changes in the architecture can always happen later. Those hurdles are far smaller and should really be avoided to minimize risk. </p>

<p>As user RS Conley states above, “If it is critically important to preserve the behavior your application or if it is mission critical then conversion is the only path”.</p>

<p>Another user, MarkJ, provided us with a link to a post by Microsoft’s Eric Nelson, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dd408373.aspx#migrate" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dd408373.aspx#migrate</a>, where it says that many rewrites were abandoned due to the unexpected overwhelming complexity. We’ve heard about lots of failed rewrite attempts; some of them came to us as customers after deciding to go for a rewrite first. </p>

<p>Here’s a white paper written by a colleague of mine on this very subject:  <a href="http://www.artinsoft.com/5-myth-busting-reasons-for-choosing-automatic-migration-vs-manual-rewrite.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.artinsoft.com/5-myth-busting-reasons-for-choosing-automatic-migration-vs-manual-rewrite.aspx</a></p>

<p>Don't try to enhance the functionality of the application until the move to .Net is complete. It is easy to let the scope of the project runaway from you. It's tempting while you've got the patient on the table to do some other overdue preventative care but resist the temptations. A .Net migration is not for the faint of heart. </p>

<p>You should look for a tool that will preserve your business logic. That will convert as many third-party components to their .Net equivalent as possible. Depending on what coding standards were in places when your application was originally written and how well the standards were followed thereafter, it's best to find a tool that will maintain the class structure of your application so that your existing developers don't need to relearn how to navigate through the code.  This can save a lot of time getting back to the business at hand.  Please bear in mind as well that if the original application is poorly written, then the code that results from an automatic migration might not be idea. What’s the expression, “garbage in, garbage out”?</p>

<p>Either way, let me know if I can be of any further assistance. Hopefully my comments have provide some useful insight.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
