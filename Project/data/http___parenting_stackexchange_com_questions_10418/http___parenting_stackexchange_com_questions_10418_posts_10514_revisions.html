            <p>Even if asked, how can a dad be both a mother and father (which I think it should be), I think this more useful question doesn't exactly fit your circumstances.   Your son <em>has</em> a mother -- you do not need to be both mother and father.  What you want to know is, are there social/emotional things he would normally learn from his mother <em>because she is a mother</em>, either explicitly or from his relationship with her, that are essential to his becoming an emotionally and socially well-rounded individual.  Or even, what benefits accrue to a child who has a mother, specifically because she is a mother, not a dad?</p>

<p>My short answer is, there is nothing a mother needs to do that a dad cannot also do (see Valkyrie, balanced mama, OldCurmudgeon, et al.); and your concern with his emotional growth, your understanding that you have a stereotypical masculine way of parenting and that there are other ways of doing things, and your sensitivity towards your wife, tell us that you will provide him with everything a mother <em>needs</em> to supply.  And the extras -- someone to make Mother's Day cards for in school; another person in his life to love him unconditionally -- his mother can still supply.</p>

<p>My longer take on the question is, I think perhaps you are worrying if at some point style can become substance.  That is, maybe you kissed his toes at four weeks, but stopped when he turned three -- but you think your wife would still be doing it.  So he's missing out on that.  Or maybe one of his playmates fell on the playground last week, and you watched his mother swoop down to gather him up, all concern and kisses; while the day before you had just told your son cheerfully, "You're all right, buddy," and watched while he picked himself up and began playing again.  Or maybe you're wondering about all those long discussions about feelings that women are supposed to have.</p>

<p>So, does your son need, for his social and emotional growth, someone to do the things you see other mothers doing that are not part of your style?</p>

<p>I say, "No."</p>

<p>Children need lots of loving touch.  That can be lots of hugs and kisses; or it can be lots of wrestling matches on the living room floor, then sitting side-by-side afterwards (or him sitting in your lap) to watch the ball game.</p>

<p>Children need to have their physical hurts taken care of.  Anything serious you will deal with; for minor scrapes, <em>everybody</em> has their own style.  I know a mom who cheerfully tells her three girls, "Just rub it!" even after one gets hit by a pitch.  And another who says, "Shake it off!" and has taught her daughter to brush her hands together briskly, like she was shaking sand off them.  My own style was to kiss it better, but around age three I started telling my daughter, "Yup, that one will hurt for a minute, then be better," or "That will hurt for five minutes."  And while we're none of us happy to see our daughters get smashed into the boards during a rough game, by the way, we certainly don't jump up and run down to the ice.</p>

<p>Children need to be told explicitly, "I love you."  I'm sure you do that!  But also, when I come home from work, sometimes I just stand and look at my daughter, letting only my face show that I think she's the most amazing creature in the universe and I am so gratified to have her -- and after a few moments her face totally lights up and she comes and flings her arms around me.</p>

<p>Children need to understand how feelings work, that everyone has them, that a lot of what people say and do is driven by their feelings, and that it's possible for one person to take something personally when another person didn't mean it that way.  I have long talks with my daughter at bedtime about things that happened during the day, and how she felt about something -- and how did she think another kid felt about something? -- frequently comes up.  But I know a mom of two sons who has all these discussions in the car, on their way somewhere.  In fact, if either of the boys needs to talk about something, he asks to go for a ride.  I'm guessing there's something safe about the way they don't sit facing each other in these conversations that lowers the risk or the intensity.</p>

<p>I'd also add that you can talk to him about style, that every parent wants to protect their child, but we also want them to grow up as strong, capable individuals, and we all have different ideas of how to balance the two. I'm very meta with my daughter; I tell her what I'm trying to accomplish in raising her (though I don't tell her all my tricks!), just like I show her how the world works in other ways.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.  I know it was long!</p>
