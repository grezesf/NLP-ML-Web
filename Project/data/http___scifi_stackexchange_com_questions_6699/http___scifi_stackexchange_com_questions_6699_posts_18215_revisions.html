and Fluttershy<span class="diff-add"> ages</span>, I myself could put Pinkie Pie around... 18 or 17<span class="diff-add"> years of age</span>- She
foalsits and she bakes at Sugar Cube Corner, and lives with strangers

</span><li><p> And<span class="diff-add"> now to Fluttershy.</span> Fluttershy did say in an episode<span class="diff-add"> of My Little Pony</span> she<span class="diff-add"> is</span> a year older then Pinkie Pine<span class="diff-add">. And as I said. Pinkie Pie is 17 or 18, so that</span> means she is 18 or 19 years<span class="diff-add"> old</span>.<span class="diff-add">&nbsp; </span></p></li><span class="diff-add">
</span><li><p> For Rainbow Dash? I coooould say she is the same age as Pinkie Pie or Fluttershy,<span class="diff-add"> so</span> 17-19 years old.<span class="diff-add">&nbsp;</span></p></li><span class="diff-add">

</span><li><p><span class="diff-add"> Now to Rarity. She owns her own tailor shop and makes her own clothes. So she can be around 20s? She could be hitching the same road with Applejack in the 20’s. To exactly tell who is the oldest between the two? Or if they are the same age. Not sure, but I would put them early 20's.</span></p></li><span class="diff-add">
</span><li><p><span class="diff-add"> For Twilight Sparkle? I could put her between the ages of... 16-19.</span>
<span class="diff-add">Because Twilight being out of school in a manners of sorts, and being out of

<li><p><span class="diff-add"> And being the baby sister of Shining Armor, who Shining may be

<li><p><span class="diff-add"> And to add more common sense to this whole statement, since she is

                <p> I would assume. That what is being said. 17-20 years old. Applejack. Beind the middle child of the Apple family, and a worker for the family, and of course being the last to get her cutie mark. I would put her the oldest or second oldest of the Mane 6. To why Granny SMith looks old and wrinkly. Luna and her sister are Alicorns, and are immortal. Can't die from age. Common sense to add to this. If being immortal. You would reach your max growth and stay that way. AWhile Granny Smith she's just a Earth Pony.  For Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash, well. I could say they may be the youngest of the other 6, but maybe not. To who is the oldest between the two. I could put Pinkie Pie around... 18<span class="diff-delete">-ish</span>- She foalsits and she bakes. Would you honestly trust your kid to be left alone to cook and baby sit? And Fluttershy did say is<span class="diff-delete"> he</span> a year older. So 19. Is my best guess. Rainbow Dash? I coooould say she is the same age as Pinkie Pie or Fluttershy. Since<span class="diff-delete"> they both know</span> each other since they were young. Now to Rarity. She owns her own tailor shop. So she can be around 20s? Hitching the same road with Applejack. Twilight Sparkle? I cooooould put her between the ages of... 17-19.</p>

Twilight being out of school in a manners of sorts. And being the baby sister of Shinning, who may be around 30s. And adding more common sense. I can say she went through the rest of the school year too. She did get private schooling from Celstia. So.
Applejack: 20-23
Rarity: 20-23
Twilight Sparkle: Assuming my best guess. 17.
Rainbow Dash: 18
Fluttershy: 19.
Pinkie Pie: 18
Granny Smith: Pretty damn old. 100-ish</span>.</p>
