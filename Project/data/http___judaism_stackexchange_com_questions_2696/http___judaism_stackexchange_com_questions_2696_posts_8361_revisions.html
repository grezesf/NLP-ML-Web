            <p> I wrote a piece on another <a href="http://www.jewneric.com/2008/04/04/re-kippot-at-job-interviews/" rel="nofollow">blog</a> about 3 years ago,<span class="diff-delete"> and</span><span class="diff-add"> that</span> I think<span class="diff-delete"> it</span> is still valid as a general rule with regard to wearing a Kippah at job interviews or at work.  And I still believe that if an employer won't tolerate your wearing a Kippah you may not want to work there, but everyone needs to make his own decision.  However, in your particular case, it sounds like your employer is violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which ensures religious freedom (among other freedoms) in the workplace in the U.S. Of course, I don't know if you are located/working in the U.S., but if you are, it might be worth reporting it to the United States <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/employees/charge.cfm" rel="nofollow">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a>.</p>

<p> Just to paraphrase the closing paragraph from the other piece, what I have to say on the subject in general is this: it's a personal choice. If you feel wearing a Kippah is hurting you in your employment or job search, you have every right to take it off - <em>and you have every right to put it back on at any point</em>. However, be prepared to be made uncomfortable for doing so, and begin looking for a new job with an employer that can see past it - <em>all while diligently doing your job</em>. On the other hand, if you choose to wear it, I will give you the Berachah (blessing) given to me by a rabbi I consulted on the subject: You will get a job that is good for you (either by this one changing to become friendlier or another one), and being Moser Nefesh will come back to reward you, either in this world or the next. Even if it isn't about observance/Halachah, but you simply wear your Kippah as a badge of honor and Jewish pride, continue to do so because you will ultimately find something suitable, and your colleagues – particularly in an environment where they are willing to hire someone who is proud of his heritage and beliefs – will respect you for it.</p>

He was a former member of Saddam Hussein's government, who was later put in charge of the "de-Baath-ification" of the Iraqi government after Saddam had been captured. He was (and still has been) an outspoken supporter of both the United States and Israel, and was (and probably still has been) told repeatedly by those in the government that if he would simply stop speaking out in support of Israel, he would be given the full backing of the Iraqi leadership. Instead, he continued to speak out on Israel's behalf, and was stripped of his security detail, threatened with death, and lost his two sons in a bomb attack meant to kill him. I was asked to help, not with security or money or connections – these were all things he was handling on his own – but simply</span><span class="diff-add"> Just</span> to<span class="diff-delete"> give</span><span class="diff-add"> paraphrase</span> the<span class="diff-delete"> man a ride to his hotel</span><span class="diff-add"> closing paragraph</span> from<span class="diff-delete"> the event we were both attending. I said yes, and I promptly removed my Kippah before being introduced to him, so that nobody would see him – or worse, photograph him – shaking hands with a Jew. The man's life was on the line, and my personal, outward expression of my own Jewishness could not take precedence in this case.</span></p><p><span class="diff-delete"> Other than that, I have always worn a Kippah, including to every job interview I have ever had – and there were many! One reason I believe I had so many interviews before I found my first job, is actually because I wore my Kippah. Now, you may say, "Seth, you're making a pretty bold leap to assume that every employer who interviewed you was anti-Semitic!" That would be true if that were the leap I were making. In fact, I don't believe that anyone who interviewed me was an anti-Semite. I actually interviewed with a lot of Jews! But I interviewed for jobs in political offices, in which the first face to be seen by constituents walking in the door would have been mine, and the first head to be seen would have had a Kippah on it. I think there were two assumptions being made, depending on the office. The first was not that a Jew could not be trusted, but that a Jew would not be well received by the constituents; the second was that a young Jew beginning a family would not want to be there very long and would look for his first opportunity for advancement, not because of a selfish drive, but because Jews value family, and a low-paying, starter job is not conducive to those values.</span></p><p><span class="diff-delete"> As if to validate my suspicions of the former, about a year into my job search, I noticed that one interviewer glanced – very quickly, and only with his eyes – at the top of my head. Then I began to notice it a lot more. I believe it had been happening all along, but without my noticing it. I began to be very aware of it, and I noticed that when that happened, the interview usually did not go as well as others. Sometimes, though, it went even better – as if the interviewer were intrigued and wanted to see if I could overcome this handicap, I would on those occasions be asked very interesting and unusual questions, and made to feel like the job were about to be handed to me if I gave the right answer! Obviously it didn't happen in every interview – I don't think – and I was probably denied some jobs for simple reasons like timing and my qualifications versus those of</span> the other<span class="diff-delete"> applicants. I'm just saying that it happened – a lot.</span></p><p><span class="diff-delete"> Then, a little over a year ago, I had a terrific interview for a job with a Jewish congressman with mostly Jewish staff, at least his senior staff – those doing the interview. The interview went phenomenally well. I was articulate, they liked my resume and a close friend of the primary interviewer had referred me for the job. Two weeks later, after I had not heard anything, I asked my referral to call and see what was going on. She did, and she reported to me that her friend had told her he was concerned that, because I'm a young, married, Jewish man, I would not want to stick around that long in the position because it did not pay well, and they really needed someone they could keep for at least two years. That was my first introduction to discrimination of the latter kind.</span></p><p><span class="diff-delete"> It's a tough choice. I don't agree with those who say that if you want to be respected by your employers you need to wear it to the interview or forget about wearing it to work. My feeling on that is simple: if they don't know you're Jewish and they like you for the skills you bring to the table, they have no right – legally or morally – to be upset to discover that in fact you are Jewish when you walk in the door on your first day. If they are upset, or if they feel betrayed, that is bigotry of the worst kind</span><span class="diff-add"> piece</span>,<span class="diff-delete"> and I would agree that you wouldn't want to work for an employer who feels that way – but you know</span> what<span class="diff-delete">, now you've got a job and are gaining experience, and you can use that experience to help you find a job with a different employer who doesn't have that problem.</span></p><p><span class="diff-delete"> Shortly before I got my current job a bit over a year ago, I asked a rabbi if he felt that in practice I had taken a non-verbal Neder (oath) to wear a Kippah at all interviews, since I had stubbornly refused to remove it on principle up to that point. He said no, he could see no Halachic (Jewish legal) reason to compel me to continue wearing it. But he felt</span> I<span class="diff-delete"> should anyway, because that's my way of being Moser Nefesh – giving of myself – for the sake of Heaven, and it's important to hold firm to my beliefs and convictions even in the face of daunting adversity. He also made the point above, with which I still disagree, that it is unfair and deceitful to the employer to take it off for the interview and wear it when I start the job.</span></p><p><span class="diff-delete"> What I</span> have to say on the subject in general is this: it's a personal choice. If you feel<span class="diff-delete"> it</span><span class="diff-add"> wearing a Kippah</span> is hurting you in your<span class="diff-add"> employment or</span> job search, you have every right to take it off<span class="diff-delete">, and you have every right to put it back on when you begin your job</span><span class="diff-add"> - </span><em><span class="diff-add">and you have every right to put it back on at any point</span></em>.

And I still believe that if an employer won't tolerate your wearing a Kippah you may not want to work there, but everyone needs to make his own decision.  However, in your particular case, it sounds like your employer is violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which ensures religious freedom (among other freedoms) in the workplace in the U.S. Of course, I don't know if you are located/working in the U.S., but if you are, it might be worth reporting it to the United States <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/employees/charge.cfm" rel="nofollow"><span class="diff-add">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span></a>.</p><div class="diff-skipped"><div></div></div>
