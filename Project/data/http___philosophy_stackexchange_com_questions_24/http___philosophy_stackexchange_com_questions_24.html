	<span class="comment-copy">@Chris S, I voted down because it&#39;s a classic irritating-question-professors-ask-their-non-philosopher-students, not a classic philosophical quandary.  I cannot prove I am not dreaming, and the OP knew that when he asked the question.  There is nothing useful to be discussed related to this prompt.  Questions about skepticism and solipsism are relevant and interesting philosophical queries, but challenging us to prove we are not dreaming is a waste of time.</span>

	<span class="comment-copy">@adrianos - <i>If reality is only interpretations of chemical signals in your brain, who is making this interpretation.</i> I think many contemporary philosophers would suggest that &quot;who&quot; is an illusion. There is no man behind the curtain, no guiding entity behind our brain that is controlling the machine; rather, we <i>are</i> our brains. In other words, our brains are complex machines that process a lot of data with many complicated feedback looks and the like. The feeling that we have as &quot;controllers&quot; at the helm of this brain is simply a byproduct of these processes, ultimately a trick of the mind.</span>

    <div class="post-text"><p>This is actually an easier question than it seems, largely because it operates on assumptions that are easily conceded to or missed. </p>

<p>The first assumption is that reality is absolutely compartmentalized; it is not. </p>

<ul>
<li>Where does Greek end and Latin begin? That's a harder question than it looks like if you pay attention to language and there's a whole book dedicated to studying the indistinction between languages. It's called <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?tid=10473&amp;ttype=2"><em>Echolalias</em></a>.</li>
<li>Is Beckett's <em>The Unnameable</em> a book in the same way that Joyce's Ulysses and Nietzsche's <em>Will to Power</em> are books? Is an <em>oeuvre</em> everything a philosopher published or do notes and fragments count to? Are these easy questions? Nope, and these are just some of the unitary ideas Foucault pulls apart in <em>The Archaeology of Knowledge</em>. You could say that these details don't matter if this is but a dream, but then apparently at least your dream would itself call for these distinctions in mode of being, so being in a dream right now wouldn't matter.</li>
</ul>

<p>The second assumption is that perception must be observably identical in dream and reality; they are not. For every instance I ask you what you sense or remember in a dream, there are observable regularities that can be distinguished from the regularities of sense in waking life, lucid dreaming only exacerbating that distinction. Even if you're in a dream right now, then as far as your dream goes, there are two distinct realities which negate the need to even remark on the possibility that this is all a dream.</p>

<p>The third assumption is that absolute necessity exist; it does not. Hume dispelled that idea in his <em>Essay concerning Human Understanding</em> and we haven't successfully refuted him since.</p>

<p>I hope I'm being helpful.</p>

    <div class="post-text"><p>Two interesting arguments from recent decades relevant to this are Wittgenstein's Private Language Argument and the doctrine of Semantic Externalism.</p>

<p>Wittgenstein argues in Philosophical Investigations that it is impossible for there to be a language which only referrs to private, inner sensations.  Very roughly, the idea is that there is nothing which could count as misapplying a word used to refer only to an internal mental state. Correct and incorrect depend essentially upon external frames of reference as reflected in the responses of others.  The argument is targetted at empiricism, but it is clearly applicable to the skeptic who claims we are dreaming, for it would be impossible, if Wittgenstein is right, to ever <em>refer</em> to one's own dream experience if dreaming was all one ever knew.</p>

<p>Semantic externalism is a doctrine associated with Davidson, Putnam, Burge and to some extent, Kripke. This is the doctrine that it is an essential component of language that it is not an internal psychological state, that meanings must be grounded in a shared, external world. When you speak words I must take you as referring to something common to both our worlds, or else there would be no basis for successful communication.  A shared, outer world is a <em>precondition</em> of communication. The idea is similar to Wittgenstein's. </p>

<p>I have not presented either argument in any detail, but really have just sketched them in order to answer the question.  They are anti-skeptical arguments which apply equally to the claims that we are dreaming, decieved by a demon, or are a brain in a vat.  They are widely accepted as effective in proving that any language user cannot have always been dreaming, always deceived about the reference of his words, for language must have been learned in a shared environment.  But the arguments cannot really show that I am not dreaming or hallucinating <em>right now</em>.  They do however try to show that deception cannot be the norm.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DOOLITTLE But how do you know you
  exist?</p>
  
  <p>BOMB #20 It is intuitively obvious.</p>
  
  <p>DOOLITTLE Intuition is no proof. What
  concrete evidence do you have of your
  own existence?</p>
  
  <p>BOMB #20 Hmm... Well, I think,
  therefore I am.</p>
  
  <p>DOOLITTLE That's good. Very good. Now
  then, how do you know that anything
  else exists?</p>
  
  <p>BOMB #20 My sensory apparatus reveals
  it to me.</p>
  
  <p>DOOLITTLE Right!</p>
  
  <p>BOMB #20 This is fun.</p>
  
  <p>DOOLITTLE All right now, here's the
  big question: how do you know that the
  evidence your sensory apparatus
  reveals to you is correct? [...] What
  I'm getting at is this: the only
  experience that is directly available
  to you is your sensory data. And this
  data is merely a stream of electrical
  impulses which stimulate your
  computing center.</p>
  
  <p>BOMB #20 In other words, all I really
  know about the outside universe
  relayed to me through my electrical
  connections.</p>
  
  <p>DOOLITTLE Exactly.</p>
  
  <p>BOMB #20 Why, that would mean... I
  really don't know what the outside
  universe is like at all, for certain.</p>
  
  <p>DOOLITTLE That's it.</p>
  
  <p>BOMB #20 Intriguing. I wish I had more
  time to discuss this matter.</p>
  
  <p>DOOLITTLE Why don't you have more
  time?</p>
  
  <p>BOMB #20 Because I must detonate in
  seventy- five seconds.</p>

	<span class="comment-copy">@stoicfury But that&#39;s logically impossible. If it didn&#39;t conform to some standard or consensus, then by failing to conform to that standard or consensus, it would be accurately reporting that failure. To fail to report an actual failure would be incorrect, but to accurately report an actual failure is <i>correct</i>, not incorrect. The concept that sensory data can be incorrect is only meaningful if you believe the sensory data is unreal or purely metaphysical in nature. If sensory data is regarded as part of reality (as it should be), then it always accurately reports reality, including itself.</span>

    <div class="post-text"><p>If I am dreaming now, then it is a much more coherent and stable dream than what I normally call a dream. When I wake up and think about the dream, I realize that locations, people, and circumstances in the dream were constantly shifting, and there it is impossible to put together a rational story. Sometimes I even notice these qualities while I'm dreaming, and I figure out that I'm in a dream. However, what I think of as waking life does not have those qualities. I can think back across the span of my life to my earliest memories and put together a narrative where one event leads to another, places are stable, and people move in and out of the story in an orderly fashion. Also, in my interactions with people, they appear to have experiences of the same kind as my own, both in dreaming and in waking life.</p>

<p>Therefore, if this life "is not real," I would think it has to be an extremely well done and elaborate simulation, on the order of The Matrix, rather than something like the dreams I experience.</p>

    <div class="post-text"><p>You want me to prove to a sceptic that I am not dreaming?</p>

<p>Depends how cooperative they are:</p>

<p>Do you agree that a dream is a fictional experience; one where someone (how about we call them a dreamer) experiences the appearance of reality, but there is nothing but that experience?</p>

<p>That no object operates under it's own internal logic, but is simply a surface with no back to it, like an old-fashioned movie set, that has reality only as a direct experience?</p>

<p>And do you also believe that it is possible to be unsure of someone else having a conscious experience separate from your own, because their mental experience is not directly accessible? </p>

<p>If so then only one person can be in the same dream at once, because someone else's own experience of the world is not directly accessible, and so not part of that world of surfaces.</p>

<p>Therefore if I am in a dream, you do not experience the world. And I'm not saying that your experienced consciousness is an illusion (whatever that means), I'm saying you're not seeing these words right now.</p>

<p>If you are seeing them I am not in a dream you are a part of.</p>

<p>(And bear in mind that then there is also the possibility that I, the person who is typing this, do not experience anything. I would disagree, but it doesn't matter, because as a person in your dream I would have no experience of your dream. I would still not be dreaming, not be a dreamer etc.) </p>

<p>That's the sort of way I would go, but proving anything to anyone logically depends on what they already accept.</p>

    <div class="post-text"><p>Thomas Metzinger addresses some of these questions in his work, including <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0465020690" rel="nofollow" title="The Ego Tunnel: The Science of the Mind and the Myth of the Self">The Ego Tunnel: The Science of the Mind and the Myth of the Self</a>. The central question in that book is how the self, the apparently stable core of identity and consciousness, is constructed; that involves understanding what purposes it serves, and understanding situations of incomplete consciousness and identity, such as dreaming.</p>

<p>Most often, when we are dreaming, we don't know that we are dreaming, but it quickly becomes obvious to us when we are fully awake that we were dreaming. Metzinger spends some time discussing lucid dreaming, in which case someone is conscious that they are dreaming. He mentions in passing some techniques for increasing the likelihood of lucid dreaming: mostly developing routines of checking for inconsistencies in one's environment and in the sequence of events, in hopes of following one of these routines within a dream, noticing inconsistencies, and persisting in the dream while more conscious.</p>

<p>An idea Metzinger develops is that human consciousness and sense of identity is a model of reality that is actively constructing from sense data, checked for consistency, and with our physical sense of our bodily processes as a sort of carrier signal that allows for a central point of reference. Call this model-0; we are capable of creating alternate models, and comparing them to model 0, which both requires the ability to immerse oneself in alternate models and the ability to recognize which one is model 0; that recognition depends upon one's innate sense of their own body and their recognition of the consistency of experience.</p>

<p>I suppose you might imagine that there is a model -1, in which one is more conscious than one is in model 0, just as one is more conscious in model 0 than when dreaming. While I don't think this can be absolutely disproven, I would suggest that we can describe our awareness of our relative level of consciousness as a curved line that approaches a horizontal asymptote. Even in dreaming, when we don't realize we are dreaming, we know that continuity and consistency are lacking, and our sense of our own physical state is very distant, but these qualities can vary quite a bit even within a dream. When awake, we know our level of consciousness varies, but there is a much less dramatic difference in the range, and we know that when we are calm, well-rested, comfortable, and alert, we are about as conscious as we can be; we can tell by our own internal state that we're approaching that horizontal asymptote.</p>

    <div class="post-text"><p>Are we dreaming?</p>

<p>Case-by-case analysis.</p>

<p>Yes: Everything is a dream, ephemeral, temporary, constantly changing, and there is no inherent "existence" that is "radiated" by other "things" in this "world" (time x space) apart from our "own" mind.</p>

<p>No: This is not a dream, this is "real life" and independent of "mind" or "awareness" there will always persist an existence, which is generated by "others" in the environment, and no product of "personal" awareness/intelligence/sentience.</p>

<p>This topic is difficult to address with experimental science because we have affirmed some observer/observee obstacles to overcome in making experiments.</p>

<p>Generally: Science assumes that the human being is an unbiased, observer-on-the-sidelines, basically looking in through a window at "the world" and making talk of its "physics"</p>

<p>However, the view of the "observer" is actually biased, since the observer is necessarily part of the universe that s/he studies and observes.  It is like a knot in the thread, trying to untie itself.</p>

<p>How can you understand, truly, if "you" is dreaming, or if "you" is part of a coherent, greater reality?</p>

<p>Well, you should not rule out the simultaneity of yes/no, and the non-possibility of simultaneous yes/no, either.  These questions transcend the foundational assumptions of Science and Philosophy, and it is perhaps more intuitive to adopt a "flexible" set of fundamental thoughts, since it seems like we really want to talk about <em>Awareness</em>.</p>

<p>How <em>Aware</em> is one of a dream?  You may be engaged in it quite forcefully, invested all your "chips" and have many Possessions, Achievements, Feelings and Thoughts all within this "sand box reality."  Then, one wakes up and all understanding of gain, all benefits stemming from self-concern (concern for personal wealth, personal happiness) go poof.  Gone.</p>

<p>The "memory" may persist, but in reality there was nothing "real" about the dream.  Maybe it hurts to be apart from personal happiness, but really it shows something very interesting:  Based on our observation of the situation, our feelings changed.  If we could understand the deeper truth of how Dreams/Reality inter-played, perhaps we could understand more about how Reality/"Beyond" might inter-play.  Since, if Reality is a dream, there should be something that transcends it in all directions... When one "wakes up", perhaps a similar "poof" may occur to all our cravings and attachments (all our foundations of personal/self-awareness).</p>

<p>We are constantly confronted with the self/non-self duality in daily life: we are a consistent, rhythmically breathing piece of the greater universe, yet we feel separated at large.  Really, we observe from a "personal" point of view, but the universe itself is still greater than us all, and certainly contains "us".  We are all of the same fabric, and all teammates playing for the same team.  Perhaps it is a strange dream...</p>

<p>If it is a dream, how does one wake up?  Well, this "awakening" is commonly referred to as "Enlightenment" and it is said to come from a deep inner understanding of the "true nature of things" -- to really understand yourself as a harmonious part of the universe, to not view others as "others", and to really come to grips with the transience/temporary nature of "life".  One knows "Enlightenment" like one would know Hot and Cold -- it is perhaps one of the few desires founded on wisdom and it is the desire to "liberate the mind." </p>

<p>How does one get there?  What does it mean?</p>

<p>Welcome to the Matrix, here are your introductory pondering questions; try and resist the urge to cover them with thoughts and words (be "silent" in there!), and let the "self" contemplate these things in the tranquility of the peaceful, unobstructed mind:</p>

<p>Everything changes.  Nothing is permanent.
Around you, there is infinite creation and infinite destruction in every moment.</p>

<p>Happiness is actually awesome.
"I" strives to be happy and understood.  True happiness comes from within, since all originates from the "mind" and this "observational" point of view.  Consider that you can reflect negativity or happiness to the environment and those around you.  Stuff you reflect gets reflected back eventually.</p>

<p>Continuity of the "one" object.
We say the universe is made of pieces-parts, but really, you could never just delete a planet from the universe and still call it the universe.  You'd compromise the "structural integrity" in a way, but really you would be changing a lot in order to make sure one planet got "deleted" because it's all part of one continuous flow, and you'd need energy that was somehow "extra" energy -- energy that was beyond all the types of energy our universe is used to.  Something that could both ease the flow and "remove" things...</p>

<p>Divisions of objects/things:
Every "object" that one can identify is just an agreed-upon convention for naming/communicating.  Really, at any instant, you can't say that "you" is made of the same atoms, feelings, thoughts, or state of mind.  Everything is in flux, so where is "you"?  Where is any object?  It is founded in the mind, and if you get good at watching/observing your own mind, you can start to understand the "formation" of desires and the "formation" of <em>perception of objects</em> (reification).</p>

<p>Understanding that the observer is still a part of the "observed" is a good place to start in trying to attain the insight you want, I think.  Everyone's approach is different, although sometimes there is significant overlap in coming to "true understanding" between people and methods.  Really, the process of living is finding out which method is right for you.  If you hear something wise, and believe it to be so, do not discredit it due to the source.  A dog's bark might enlighten you one day, you never know what your spark, what your trigger may be.</p>

<p>The more you contemplate it, the more you will be able to explain to others your ideas.  Really, you should be patient until you feel like you've found the right question to ask.  Even if you have access to omniscient wisdom, it's all about asking the right questions.</p>

    <div class="post-text"><p>My whole use of the word "dream" -- probably yours too! -- comes from a lot of experience in which it referred to things that aren't like my current circumstances. I can't wish away walls (as Lennart pointed out); my memories of the recent past are relatively orderly; people and things aren't more likely to appear just because I've been thinking about them.</p>

<p>So under a theory of language where that matters, there's your answer: none of my training in using "dream" in sentences would license me saying that I'm in a dream right now, and I doubt many other people's would either.</p>

<p>The other obvious senses in which this might be a dream (maybe we're all trapped inside the Matrix!) seem to involve radical skepticism of a sort that would make philosophy pointless. That's not evidence for or against my life being a dream, but it does suggest a limit to how much energy it's worth spending on this <em>particular</em> skeptical question.</p>

However, to say that you're dreaming all the time is a bad explanation. Everything that happens in a dream is in your head and is uninfluenced by the rest of the world to a large extent. So if you are dreaming all the time, then there are parts of your mind that act as if they are entirely independent of you. Every time you hear a piece of music you think you could not have produced, or some scientific theory you think you could not have discovered, you must be wrong about that if you're dreaming. And every time you fail to foresee some problem, and you apparently struggle to fix it, really that problem was invented by you. And if you walk out into traffic the cars might not brake in time, but why not if they are just part of you rather than autonomous physical systems?</p>

    <div class="post-text"><p>Bear with my only-slightly-and-probably-annoyingly-not-coherent rant here...</p>

<p>Logically, I don't think we can prove we're not dreaming. Interestingly enough, I've never wanted to prove I wasn't dreaming when I <em>was</em> dreaming, only when I'm <em>not</em> dreaming. (Of course, you could argue that I <em>could</em> have been dreaming when I thought I wasn't...) </p>

<p>As mentioned, our senses are deceptive and can't be used to really prove anything (except insofar that agreement on the state of something approaches unanimity.</p>

<p>Obviously there's a scientific proof that could be made, which of course hinges on the reliability of our senses in accepting scientific data, but if we accept that that data is correct, we could examine the state of our brain and "prove" that we are not dreaming. Keep in mind that science can't <em>prove</em> anything, and that whoever you were trying to convince that you were not dreaming would have to agree on the state of your brain. </p>

<p>Mentally, I think you could semi-prove to yourself that you are or are not dreaming based on the state of your brain. 
If I</p>

<ol>
<li>Make an assumption that X part of my life is <em>not</em> a dream...</li>
<li>Label the current point in time "Y"</li>
<li>Analyze mental patterns inside X</li>
<li>Analyze mental patterns inside Y</li>
<li>Compare X's patterns to Y's patterns</li>
</ol>

<p>I can arrive at a <em>scientific</em> conclusion as to the dreaming state of my brain. Keep in mind that this relies on my ability to analyze those mental patterns, my capability of extrapolation, and the reliability of my analysis. Again, Science can't <em>prove</em> anything, so this is at best simply a way of convincing yourself, mentally.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I don't think there <em>is</em> any logical proof (i know, that doesn't answer your question. Sorry :) ) because the logic we're able to work with, at least as far as dreams go, relies on empirical data. </p>

    <div class="post-text"><p>We are constantly dreaming.</p>

<p>Our mind is a simulator, which tries to model reality using memory and the senses. When we are dreaming during our sleep, this simulator is running without real data from our senses.</p>

<ul>
<li>it is necessary for survival that a minimal amount of simulation is present: if a lion roars we wake up, because the simulator must identify this, much like a sleeping computer with a screensaver, and power management is not completely shut off, because computers that dont flexibly change clocking frequency and disk readiness on touching the mouse wont sell better and their design wont survive...</li>
</ul>

<p>So the answer we know we are always dreaming is probably not what you seek. So to rephrase your question: how do we know that what we perceive corresponds to reality?</p>

<ul>
<li>Consider the following example: you go out your house, your keys are in your pocket, do some things in the city, return home and find yourself locked out, your keys arent really in your pocket, your mind misinterpreted your loose change for the keys and now has to remodel the past as you realize your mistake</li>
</ul>

<p>Theres different levels of reality, and it should not be seen as a scalar:</p>

<p>you can ask it as a binary question meaning: are my senses mostly suppressed and is my body in its resting state while it seems like im awake (what most people call dreaming). Then youd probably want to consult lucid dreaming books with tips on reality checks.
Here seeing the mind as on or off is a first order approximation: you can realize you are dreaming and know that the real reality is different from what you experience</p>

<p>For the second kind of reality: it doesnt really hold as a property for your mind as a whole and much more refinement is needed: the belief that your keys were in your pocket was incorrect, so its a per statement property...</p>

<p>Science can be seen as the simulator of all observations not just from human senses but also from measurement sensors, we try to interpret the data in multiple ways, and we sometimes find ourselves hampered by insuitable frameworks,... i.e. societies have actively dreamed of witches and hunted them down..</p>

If I dreamed right now instead of writing this, I would be in a beautiful world of strange places, telling me of my knowledge and what I have to do when I wake up in the world I typed this. My dreams are my responsibilities, the think tanks for ideas and knowledge of reality. It thus came to me that all works out for the best, when I dreamed that this is a delusion, which means it's not. Therefore it's not a shock this world as long as it's a dream, don't be afraid to wake up, and don't be afraid to dream, I created the way things are felt, so I commit myself to this world as a world to never listen to people, haha, I'm ideal, since the pleasures is all that avoids pain, I will never listen!</p>

    <div class="post-text"><p>I absolutely love Kierkegaard's response to skepticism.  To paraphrase, the problem is the abstract notion of certainty which doubt demands all be measured against. There is certainty that I'm not dreaming, but it's not like mathematical certainty or logical necessity... it's far more fleeting than that.  The question "Could I be dreaming?" is a question asked <em>in</em> doubt.  The answer Kierkegaard gives is that doubt cannot overcome itself: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I want to keep on doubting, I shall never in all eternity advance
  any further, because doubt consists precisely in and by passing off
  that certainty as something else.  If I hold on to the certainty as
  certainty for one single moment, I must also stop doubting for that
  moment.  But then it is not doubt that cancels itself; it is I who
  stops doubting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I get the sense that the later Wittgenstein and the ordinary language philosophers are of this school.  They're not designing litmus tests of dreaming (private language), or "proving" that the fact of language means that we cant be dreaming, but to reveal those questions as absurd, and to bring us back to a position where thoughts of skepticism about other minds etc don't arise.</p>

<p>The quotes are taken from a pseudonymous work of his, <em>Concluding Unscientific Postscript</em>, extract from Kierkegaard, Søren. The Essential Kierkegaard. Edited by Howard Vincent Hong and Edna Hatlestad Hong. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2000.

  <p>How does one know one is not dreaming?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Different Understanding</strong></p>

<p>This question may assert different understanding:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First understanding: The question asserts <strong>"How can we know that we are not placed on reality that are similar but fake?"</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This understanding asserts condition that generally know as <em>false awakening state</em>. It's where we were thinking on waking life, but actually we were still dreaming about our waking life.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Second understanding: The question asserts <strong>"How can we know that we are not placed on reality that are completely different but fake?"</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This understanding asserts condition that we are living on completely different scenarios of life and we are considering it is a continuation. For example: somehow we were awake and saw anything different and somehow we knew that might be it's because of an earthquake. The question is, are we living now at the same place or at different realm?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Third understanding: Dream realm is something less real than another realm (that may be considered as real as it should be). Regarding to this understanding, the question may be interpreted as <strong>"How does one know one is not placed on environment that less real than what it should be"?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This understanding gives consequence, that even when we were succeed placed outside dreaming, again, we should ask, whether we are placed on different dream realm or we are now living on reality as it should be.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Continuation as It should be</strong></p>

<p>The key to response these situations by understanding that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Whether we are living on fake reality or we are living on something that less real as it should be (whether we don't know how for something must be considered as real as it should be), but one thing we have to be sure that <strong>there are continuations from our past life</strong> (past scenarios) <strong>to our current life</strong> (current scenarios).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Continuation as it shouldn't be, is the real fake living</strong>. Whether we always know that our life are entirely duplications but as long as our continuations are as it should be, then everything are as it should be.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Therefore, asking <strong>"how do we know we are not dreaming?"</strong> must be interpreted (<strong>equal to</strong>) as asking <strong>"how do we know that this current life is the real continuation from the past life as it should be?"</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Different degree of comparison</strong></p>

<p>"How do we know that this current life is the real continuation from the past life as it should be?" "How do we know that this current life is the fake continuation?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The essence is based on how far we can achieve the degree of comparison. This determines <strong>how far we can distinguish a fake continuations from the original continuations</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It can be provided by switching our awareness to get possibilities to know (make comparison) whether there are wrong continuations. And this <strong>degree of comparison to make comparison</strong> can be created through:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Automatic switching awareness by practicing "reality check" by ourselves</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If we want to know whether this current life is fake, we must conditioning ourselves to always asking "whether this reality is fake", and when we are sifting to a different reality, our subconscious will remind us (automatic switching quickly) to ask (know, make comparison) whether this reality is fake or not. It will gain our awareness to make a comparison whether there is another reality other than what we are experiencing. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Automatic switching awareness by practicing "reality check" by someone else (expert)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If we want to know whether this current life is fake, we need someone else to sit beside us and ask to see whether there is unusual behaviour to our awareness that may endanger our life (by checking unusual pattern from EEG - ElectroEncephalographym) or whether we are living within dream realm too long enough, and further someone else may force us to awake (automatic switching) and may be it leads us to ask (know, make comparison) whether this reality is fake or not. It will gain our awareness to make a comparison whether there is another reality other than what we are experiencing, or we just simply awake from dream state.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Manual switching by ourselves</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We can do manual switching from current operating system to the previous operating system or any kind of operating system by disconnecting our awareness manually from operating system through focus.</li>
</ul>

<p>Through focus, we can put our awareness at balance point where we can know (make comparison) that there are wrong continuation in this current life compared to unfinished tasks left behind within previous operating system.</p>

<p>Practically, we can focus on something on dreaming, then (if we succeed) something that we are focusing on it, gradually will be changed or morphing and eventually will switch us into the waking state where we can deal with continuation as it should be.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The points are</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can know whether we are dreaming or not by <strong>providing true comparison</strong> (not fake comparison) <strong>whether we are living with continuation as it should be or not</strong>.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>It can be provided by switching our awareness through <strong><em>reality check</em></strong> or</li>
  <li><strong>Focus on something</strong>. Practicing meditation will help us to switch (escape) our awareness from current state of realities to different realm or to waking state, where we can deal with our continuation as it should be.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Without these, we may be drawn into fake believe (we believe that we are not dreaming, but actually we don't realize that we are still dreaming).</p>

<p>It's not about "we are not dreaming" or "we are dreaming", but it's about we are living with continuation as it should be or not. This understanding not only put us on awareness whether we are dreaming or not, but this understanding lead us to be open minded to accept any possible realities whether we are dreaming or not and put us away from fake responsibilities for others and for ourselves. It's the essence of living.</p>
