            <p> Short answer:
The term fiber axis is not in reference to the DNA model, it comes from the experiments that Watson and Crick used to guess their model.   The fiber axis is basically the dimension along the length of the DNA strand.  </p>

<p> Longer: </p>

<p> Watson and Crick created their model of DNA based on the somewhat esoteric experiment called X-ray <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_diffraction" rel="nofollow">fiber diffraction</a>.  For<span class="diff-delete"> their</span><span class="diff-add"> the</span> experimental data (Rosalind Franklin<span class="diff-delete"> who</span> was<span class="diff-add"> actually</span> gathering<span class="diff-delete"> Fiber</span><span class="diff-add"> the fiber</span> diffraction<span class="diff-add"> data</span>) DNA is pulled out of a cell lysate and washed with buffer.  It looks like a clear, <a href="http://www.protocol-online.org/biology-forums/posts/40140.html" rel="nofollow">liquid string of snot</a> (a technical term that is).  Its stringy though because the long DNA molecules pull out and create viscous fluid where the DNA is pulled along the length of the fiber.  Because the DNA is ordered, if you shoot a beam of X-rays through it, it creates a x-pattern on film that looks like this: </p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CGbwq.jpg" alt="fiber diffraction data by Rosalind Franklin"></p>

<p> As you can see its got a nice X-shaped pattern.  This is because the DNA in the fiber is mostly aligned along the fiber, in the up and down direction.  Because this is so, the spacings between the different layers is due to the spacings between the DNA bases and the x-pattern comes from the fact that DNA forms a double helix.  </p>

<p> Some misc details - you have to use X-rays because their wavelength is about the size of an chemical bond and this is the sort of model Watson and Crick and Franklin and Wilkinson were trying to find.   </p>

<p> The fiber axis is along the y axis (top to bottom) because the trail of DNA snot hangs down - it will sag if you hold it an angle.<br>
Rosalind Franklin's contribution was that she was a great experimentalist and she realized that the DNA snot trail dries out over time and the experiment would sometimes go on for days.  She had a moist stream of hydrogen gas blowing over the DNA strand during the X-ray experiment and so was the only experimentalist who obtained what we now know to be the true result - double helical DNA.  As it dries out, DNA interconverts to the Z-DNA form I believe, which does not have the x-pattern and also confuses things because the result is a smear of the DNA helix converting from one form to another.   </p>

<p> Francis Crick had actually predicted the x-pattern for helices.  The structure actually required these two to come together to get the answer while the American genius Linus Pauling was working hard in California on the structure as well.  </p>

            <p> Short answer:
The term fiber axis is not in reference to the DNA model, it comes from the experiments that Watson and Crick used to guess their model.   The fiber axis is basically the dimension along the length of the DNA strand.  </p>

<p> Longer: </p>

<p> Watson and Crick created their model of DNA based on the somewhat esoteric experiment called X-ray <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_diffraction" rel="nofollow">fiber diffraction</a>.  For their<span class="diff-delete"> experiment</span><span class="diff-add"> experimental data</span> (<span class="diff-delete">and for Rosalind</span><span class="diff-add">Rosalind</span> Franklin who was<span class="diff-delete"> also doing</span><span class="diff-add"> gathering</span> Fiber diffraction) DNA is pulled out of a cell lysate and washed with buffer.  It looks like a clear, <a href="http://www.protocol-online.org/biology-forums/posts/40140.html" rel="nofollow">liquid string of snot</a> (a technical term that is).  Its stringy though because the long DNA molecules pull out and create viscous fluid where the DNA is pulled along the length of the fiber.  Because the DNA is ordered, if you shoot a beam of X-rays through it, it creates a x-pattern on film that looks like this: </p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CGbwq.jpg" alt="fiber diffraction data by Rosalind Franklin"></p>

<p> As you can see its got a nice X-shaped pattern.  This is because the DNA in the fiber is mostly aligned along the fiber, in the up and down direction.  Because this is so, the spacings between the different layers is due to the spacings between the DNA bases and the x-pattern comes from the fact that DNA forms a double helix.  </p>

<p> Some misc details - you have to use X-rays because their wavelength is about the size of an chemical bond and this is the sort of model Watson and Crick and Franklin and Wilkinson were trying to find.   </p>

<p> The fiber axis is along the y axis (top to bottom) because the trail of DNA snot hangs down - it will sag if you hold it an angle.<br>
Rosalind Franklin's contribution was that she was a great experimentalist and she realized that the DNA snot trail dries out over time and the experiment would sometimes go on for days.  She had a moist stream of hydrogen gas blowing over the DNA strand during the X-ray experiment and so was the only experimentalist who obtained what we now know to be the true result - double helical DNA.  As it dries out, DNA interconverts to the Z-DNA form I believe, which does not have the x-pattern and also confuses things because the result is a smear of the DNA helix converting from one form to another.   </p>

<p> Francis Crick had actually predicted the x-pattern for helices.  The structure actually required these two to come together to get the answer while the American genius Linus Pauling was working hard in California on the structure as well.  </p>

<p> The reference for nearly all of this is Watson's somewhat self-centered but scientifically accurate book "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Double_Helix" rel="nofollow">The Double Helix</a>".  Strangely I can't find a picture of DNA snot fiber, but you can make some yourself from the protocol listed above and some saliva. </p>

For their experiment (and for Rosalind Franklin who was also doing Fiber diffraction) DNA is pulled out of a cell lysate and washed with buffer.  It looks like a clear, <a href="http://www.protocol-online.org/biology-forums/posts/40140.html" rel="nofollow">liquid string of snot</a> (a technical term that is).  Its stringy though because the long DNA molecules pull out and create viscous fluid where the DNA is pulled along the length of the fiber.  Because the DNA is ordered, if you shoot a beam of<span class="diff-add"> X-rays</span> through it, it creates a<span class="diff-add"> x</span>-<span class="diff-add">pattern</span> on film that looks like this: </p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CGbwq.jpg" alt="fiber diffraction data by Rosalind Franklin"></p>

<p> As you can see its got a nice X-shaped pattern.  This is because the DNA in the fiber is mostly aligned along the fiber, in the up and down direction.  Because this is so, the spacings between the different layers is due to the spacings between the DNA bases and the x-pattern comes from the fact that DNA forms a double helix.  </p>

<p> Some misc details - you have to use X-rays because their wavelength is about the size of an chemical bond and this is the sort of model Watson and Crick and Franklin and Wilkinson were trying to find.<span class="diff-add">   </span></p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><span class="diff-add"> The</span> fiber axis is along the y axis (top to bottom) because the trail of DNA snot hangs down - it will sag if you hold it an angle.<br><span class="diff-add">
Rosalind</span> Franklin's contribution was that she was a great experimentalist and she realized that the DNA snot trail dries out over time and the experiment would sometimes go on for days.  She had a moist stream of hydrogen gas blowing over the DNA strand during the X-ray experiment and so was the only experimentalist who obtained what we now know to be the true result - double helical DNA.  As it dries out, DNA<span class="diff-add"> interconverts to</span> the<span class="diff-add"> Z-DNA</span> form<span class="diff-add"> I believe</span>, which does not<span class="diff-add"> have</span> the<span class="diff-add"> x-pattern and also confuses things because the result is a smear of the DNA</span> helix<span class="diff-add"> converting from one form to another</span>.<span class="diff-add">   </span></p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><span class="diff-add"> Francis Crick</span> had actually predicted the x-pattern for helices<span class="diff-add">.  The structure actually required these two to come together to get the answer while the American genius Linus Pauling was working hard in California on the structure as well</span>.  </p>

<p> The reference for nearly all of this is Watson's somewhat self-centered but scientifically accurate book "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Double_Helix" rel="nofollow">The Double Helix</a>".  Strangely I can't find a picture of DNA snot fiber, but you can make some yourself from the protocol listed above and some saliva. </p>
