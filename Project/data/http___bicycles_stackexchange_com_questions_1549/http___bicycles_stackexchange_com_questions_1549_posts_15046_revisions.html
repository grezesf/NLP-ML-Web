            <p> Late to this party but some good reading here!</p>

<p> There are a couple of jewels in this thread.  The math guy proving the weight of the bike might help 2-3% is priceless.  As an overweight cyclist, when someone passes me going up a hill and they do frequently, a 10% increase in my speed wouldn't help me keep up.  I'm doing 7, their doing 12, you figure it out.</p>

<p> Then there is that comment by Lance saying it is easier to lighten the rider than the bike. So true.  When I hit my goal later in the year, I'll have lost more than the weight of the heaviest bicycle out there.</p>

<p> But here is the rub, newbies and guys like me trying to get fit and lose a few pounds are going to get messed up with this light is right stuff.  Almost every light bike I've looked at drops the 1st chain ring and has little tiny tires and many even have missing spokes.  My Surly LHT is a heavy bike and the reason I got this bike was for the gearing, it has a MTB crank set and cassette. I'm pretty sure it will climb a phone pole if you can keep the tires stuck to it.  I ride in the 3rd ring most of the time but when I need to dump down, I need to dump down.  We all agree, hills make the man (person). </p>

<p> That leaves me with the tires and wheels, going from 26x2.2 to 700.37 indeed rolls easier, but those tiny racing tires are not something I'm ready for. Perhaps it is more between my ears than real, but my Continentals ride just fine, thank you on chipped granite, something we see around here.  I cannot imagine hitting a pot hole with those little tires and half the spokes.</p>

<p> While heavy, my LHT is a very smooth ride and<span class="diff-add"> having</span> being<span class="diff-add"> professionally</span> fitted, I am comfortable on 25 mile rides. You all agree the bike has to be fun to ride and for the new guy struggling to get fit, he needs to be fitted to the bike and he needs low gears if he is going to ride hills and overpasses or the bike will not be fun.   </p>

As an overweight cyclist, when someone passes me going up a hill and they do frequently, a 10% increase in my speed wouldn't help me keep up.  I'm doing 7, their doing 12, you figure it out.</p>

<p> Then there is that comment by Lance saying it is easier to lighten the rider than the bike. So true.  When I hit my goal later in the year, I'll have lost more than the weight of the heaviest bicycle out there.</p>

<p> But here is the rub, newbies and guys like me trying to get fit and lose a few pounds are going to get messed up with this light is right stuff.  Almost every light bike I've looked at drops the 1st chain ring and has little tiny tires and many even have missing spokes.  My Surly LHT is a heavy bike and the reason I got this bike was for the gearing, it has a MTB crank set and<span class="diff-delete"> cluster</span><span class="diff-add"> cassette</span>. I'm pretty sure it will climb a phone pole if you can keep the tires stuck to it.  I ride in the 3rd ring most of the time but when I need to dump down, I need to dump down.  We all agree, hills make the man (person). </p>

<p> That leaves me with the tires and wheels, going from 26x2.2 to 700.37 indeed rolls easier, but those tiny racing tires are not something I'm ready for. Perhaps it is more between my ears than real, but my Continentals ride just fine, thank you on chipped granite, something we see around here.  I cannot imagine hitting a pot hole with those little tires and half the spokes.</p>

<p> While heavy, my LHT is a very smooth ride and being fitted, I am comfortable on 25 mile rides. You all agree the bike has to be fun to ride and for the new guy struggling to get fit, he needs to be fitted to the bike and he needs low gears if he is going to ride hills and overpasses or the bike will not be fun.   </p>
