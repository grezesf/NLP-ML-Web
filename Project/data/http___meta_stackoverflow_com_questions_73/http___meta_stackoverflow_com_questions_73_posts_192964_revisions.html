            <p> I'll answer from my personal point of view, which is not upvotes, downvotes, selection of the best answer or even reputation.  My main concern is: <strong>wasting my time</strong>, or if you prefer, <strong>not being collectivelly more efficient</strong>.  How many times I have spent 5 or more minutes writing an answer only to discover that another person was producing / had produced a very similar if not exact same one?</p>

<p> Some strategies that I have tried:</p>

<ol>
<li> Answer only questions that have been unanswered for a couple of hours.  Challenges:  To skip questions with only wrong answers (usually just one or two).  Not providing additional points of view.</li>
<li> Answer only questions that after a couple of hours have only 3 answers.  Challenges:  In many cases the 3 answers are duplicate (and possibly wrong) ones.  Very few questions to answer at all; usually only those very badly stated.  Additionally, I have noticed that duplicate answers are produced even after <strong>much more time than writing it would have normally required</strong>.  A bit off-topic, but this would mean:  a)  We are extremely slow typists,  b)  Many of us abandons SOf for important periods, only to come back and press "submit", c)  We answer questions without reading previous answers, or d)  We answer question <em>after</em> reading previous answers, probably trying to synthesize the best of them.</li>
<li> Be the fastest gun in town and try to announce to others my intention of producing an answer with a one-liner, leaving up to them to judge if my sketched answer sounds good enough or not.  Challenges:  Other contributors percieving that that's all the answer I'm going to produce and elaborating on it (precisely what I'm trying to avoid).</li>
<li>(Current)  Like 3, but being explicit in my intentions of ellaboration.  Challenges:  Wishfully none.</li>
</ol>

<p> None of them has worked very well so far.</p>

<p> My proposition is to have the site informing the user that other people is already working on answers <strong>as soon as they enter the first character</strong>, and not as late as when they press "submit" (way too late, for everybody).  Indication of the number of other people, names, reputation, maximum reputation (within the group), response length, etc. could also be very useful to me in deciding if to continue answering or not.  Using the language of economics: make it a perfect market, where everything is a personal choice, but as well informed as possible.</p>

<p> Also useful: the ability to queue questions that I have chosen not to answer for later review.</p>

<p><span class="diff-add"> Another alternative is to lock the question for a while.  And/or after certain number of answers have started to be produced.  However, somehow I'm more inclined for what you could call the liberal model, which also seems consistent with both the philosophy of the site and many opinions expressed here.</span></p><span class="diff-add">

Very few questions to answer at all; usually<span class="diff-add"> only those</span> very badly stated.  Additionally, I have noticed that duplicate answers are produced even after <strong>much more time than writing it would have normally required</strong>.  A bit off-topic, but this would mean:  a)  We are extremely slow typists,  b)  Many of us abandons SOf for important periods, only to come back and press "submit", c)  We answer questions without reading previous answers, or d)  We answer question <em>after</em> reading previous answers, probably trying to synthesize the best of them.</li>
<li> Be the fastest gun in town and try to announce to others my intention of producing<span class="diff-delete"> a (correct)</span><span class="diff-add"> an</span> answer with a one-liner, leaving up to<span class="diff-delete"> the rest if</span><span class="diff-add"> them</span> to<span class="diff-delete"> believe in</span><span class="diff-add"> judge if</span> my<span class="diff-delete"> proposition</span><span class="diff-add"> sketched answer sounds good enough or not</span>.

</ol>

<p> None of them has worked<span class="diff-delete"> really</span><span class="diff-add"> very</span> well<span class="diff-add"> so far</span>.</p>

<p> My proposition is to have the site informing the user that other people is already working on answers <strong>as soon as they enter the first character</strong>, and not as late as when they press "submit" (way too late, for everybody).  Indication of the number of other people, names, reputation, maximum reputation (within the group), response length, etc. could also be very useful to me in deciding if to continue answering or not.  Using the language of economics: make it a perfect market, where everything is a personal choice, but as well informed as possible.</p>

<p> Also useful: the ability to queue questions that I have chosen not to answer for later review.</p>
