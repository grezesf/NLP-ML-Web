            <p> Ashcroft and Mermin are occasionally not too careful about notation, and so the resolution is, as Marek mentioned in a comment, related to the fact that
$$ u_k = \sum_G c_{k-G}e^{iGr} $$
admits several solutions -- every set of coefficients $\{c\}$ corresponds to <em>some</em> function $u_k$, but we're only interested in the $n$ solutions that solve the Schroedinger equation.</p>

<p> Every delocalized band arises because of the hybridization of quantum states between unit cells. If there are $n$ states that the electron can occupy, their will be $n$ (possibly degenerate, depending on the symmetry of the $G$-space point) bands. I say this to clarify that there is no sense in which the band index corresponds to the set reciprocal lattice vectors.</p>

<p> However, to answer your last question, you're absolutely right that reduction to the first Brillouin zone does give you multiple values of $E$ for a given $k \in IBZ$. If I remember correctly A&amp;M introduce band theory by starting with the nearly free electron model and should show explicitly that this is the case. In the tight binding picture (sometimes called Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals) the energies for $k$ outside the IBZ fall back onto their values in the IBZ.</p>

<p><strong>Continued:</strong></p>

<p> Specifically, I wanted to point out that $E_n(k)=E(k+G_n)$ simply doesn't make any sense. Where did you read that? However the point is that the eigenvalues <em>that make up a particular band</em> are periodic in $G$, so it is true that $E_n(k)=E_n(k+G)$. Now, what this means is that a description with any more than the first Brillouin zone is redundant. The fact that you have multiple bands does <em>not</em> come from the reduction, though it can look that way at first, as A&amp;M present it. I suggest skipping ahead to the chapter on tight binding to understand how multiple bands arise.</p><span class="diff-add">

            <p> Ashcroft and Mermin are occasionally not too careful about notation, and so the resolution is, as Marek mentioned in a comment, related to the fact that
$$ u_k = \sum_G c_{k-G}e^{iGr} $$
admits several solutions -- every set of coefficients $\{c\}$ corresponds to <em>some</em> function $u_k$, but we're only interested in the $n$ solutions that solve the Schroedinger equation.</p>

<p> Every delocalized band arises because of the hybridization of quantum states between unit cells. If there are $n$ states that the electron can occupy, their will be $n$ (possibly degenerate, depending on the symmetry of the $G$-space point) bands. I say this to clarify that there is no sense in which the band index corresponds to the set reciprocal lattice vectors.</p>

<p> However, to answer your last question, you're absolutely right that reduction to the first Brillouin zone does give you multiple values of $E$ for a given $k \in IBZ$. If I remember correctly A&amp;M introduce band theory by starting with the nearly free electron model and should show explicitly that this is the case.
