<li> FOL is complete (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_completeness_theorem" rel="nofollow">Gödel, 1929</a>), compact and sound, and all its particular formalizations as deductive systems are equivalent (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindstr%C3%B6m%27s_theorem" rel="nofollow">Lindström, 1969</a>). That means that, given a (consistent) collection of axioms on top of a FOL deductive system, the set of all theorems which are syntactically provable, are semantically satisfied <em>at least by one model</em> of the axioms. The specification of the axioms absolutely entails all its consequences; and the fact that every first order deductive system is equivalent, suggests that FOL is a context-independent (i.e. objective), formal structure.</li>
<li> On the other hand, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skolem-L%C3%B6wenheim_theorem" rel="nofollow">Löwenheim–Skolem theorem</a> implies that FOL cannot categorically characterize infinite structures, and so every first order theory satisfied by a model of a particular infinite cardinality, is also satisfied <em>by multiple additional models</em> of every other infinite cardinality. This non-categoricity feature is explained to be caused by the lack of expressive power of FOL.</li>
<li> The categoricity results that FOL-based theories cannot achieve, can be obtained in a Second Order Logic (SOL) framework. Examples abound in ordinary mathematics, such as the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least-upper-bound_property" rel="nofollow">Least Upper Bound</a></em> axiom, which allows the definition of the real number system <em>up to isomorphism</em>. Nevertheless, SOL fails to verify an analog to the completeness results of FOL, and so there is no general match between syntactic provability and semantic satisfiability (in other words, it doesn't admit a complete proof calculus). That means that, even if a chosen collection of axioms is able to categorically characterize an infinite mathematical structure, there is an infinite set of wff's satisfied by the unique model of the axioms <em>which cannot be derived through deduction</em>.</li>
<li> The syntactic-semantic schism in SOL also implies that<span class="diff-delete"> there is no such a thing as an equivalent formulation of</span><span class="diff-add"> </span><strong><span class="diff-add">there is no such a thing as an equivalent formulation</span></strong> <span class="diff-add">of</span> potential deductive systems, as is the case in FOL and stated by Lindström's theorem. One of the results of this fact is that the domain over which second order variables range must be <em>specified</em>, otherwise being ill-defined. If the domain is allowed to be the full set of subsets of the domain of first order variables, the corresponding <strong>standard semantics</strong> involve the formal properties stated above (enough expressive power to establish categoricity results, and incompleteness of potential, non-equivalent deductive systems). On the other hand, through an appropiate definition of second order domains for second order variables to range over, the resultant logic exhibits <strong>nonstandard semantics</strong> (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henkin_model#Semantics" rel="nofollow">Henkin semantics</a>) which can be shown to be equivalent to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-sorted_first-order_logic#Many-sorted_logic" rel="nofollow">many-sorted FOL</a>; and as single-sorted FOL, it verifies the same metalogical properties stated at the begining (and of course, its lack of expressive power).</li>
<li> The quantification extension over variables of successive superior orders can be formalized, or even eliminate the distinction between individual (first order) variables and predicates; in each case, is obtained -for every N- an Nth Order Logic (NOL), and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_logic" rel="nofollow">Higher Order Logic</a> (HOL), respectively. Nevertheless, it can be shown (<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-higher-order/" rel="nofollow">Hintikka, 1955</a>) that any sentence in any logic over FOL with standard semantics to be equivalent (in an effective manner) to a sentence in full SOL, using many-sorting.</li>

<li> FOL is complete (Gödel, 1929), compact and sound, and all its particular formalizations as deductive systems are equivalent (Lindström, 1969). That means that, given a (consistent) collection of axioms on top of a FOL deductive system, the set of all theorems which are syntactically provable, are semantically satisfied by a model of the axioms. The specification of the axioms absolutely entails all its consequences; and the fact that every first order deductive system is equivalent, suggests that FOL is a context-independent (i.e. objective), formal structure.</li>
<li> On the other hand, the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem implies that FOL cannot categorically characterize infinite structures, and so every first order theory satisfied by a model of a particular infinite cardinality, is also satisfied by multiple additional models of every other infinite cardinality. This non-categoricity feature is explained to be caused by the lack of expressive power of FOL.</li>
<li> The categoricity results that FOL-based theories cannot achieve, can be obtained in a Second Order Logic (SOL) framework. Examples abound in ordinary mathematics, such as the <em>Least Upper Bound</em> axiom, which allows the definition of the real number system up to isomorphism. Nevertheless, SOL fails to verify an analog to the completeness results of FOL, and so there is no general match between syntactic provability and semantic satisfiability (in other words, it doesn't admit a complete proof calculus). That means that, even if a chosen collection of axioms is able to categorically characterize an infinite mathematical structure, there is an infinite set of wff's satisfied by the unique model of the axioms which cannot be derived through deduction.</li>
<li> The syntactic-semantic schism in SOL also implies that there is no such a thing as an equivalent formulation of potential deductive systems, as is the case in FOL and stated by Lindström's theorem. One of the results of this fact is that the domain over which second order variables range must be specified, otherwise being ill-defined. If the domain is allowed to be the full set of subsets of the domain of first order variables, the corresponding <strong>standard semantics</strong> involve the formal properties stated above (enough expressive power to establish categoricity results, and incompleteness of potential, non-equivalent deductive systems). On the other hand, through an appropiate definition of second order domains for second order variables to range over, the resultant logic exhibits <strong>nonstandard semantics</strong> (or Henkin semantics) which can be shown to be equivalent to many-sorted FOL; and as single-sorted FOL, it verifies the same metalogical properties stated at the begining (and of course, its lack of expressive power).</li>
<li> The<span class="diff-delete"> cuantification</span><span class="diff-add"> quantification</span> extension over variables of successive superior orders can be formalized, or even eliminate the distinction between individual (first order) variables and predicates; in each case, is obtained -for every N- an Nth Order Logic (NOL), and Higher Order Logic (HOL), respectively. Nevertheless, it can be shown (<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-higher-order/" rel="nofollow">Hintikka, 1955</a>) that any sentence in any logic over FOL with standard semantics to be equivalent (in an effective manner)<span class="diff-delete"> with</span><span class="diff-add"> to</span> a sentence in full SOL, using many-sorting.</li>
<li> All of this points to the fact that the fundamental distinction, in logical terms, <strong>lies between FOL</strong> (be it single-sorted or many-sorted) <strong>and SOL</strong> (with <strong>standard semantics</strong>). Or what seems to be the case, the logical foundations of every mathematical theory must be either non-categorical or lack a complete proof calculus, with nothing in between that trade-off.</li>
