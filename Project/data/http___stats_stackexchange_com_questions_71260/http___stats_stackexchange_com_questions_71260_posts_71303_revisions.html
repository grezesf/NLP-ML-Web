As we have seen, we may view the standardized distribution as arising from this basic simple situation in two steps: first, all the (standardized) $y$ values are multiplied by $\sqrt{1-\rho^2}$ for some value of $\rho$; next, all values with $x$-coordinates are vertically skewed by $\rho x$.

</span><li><p><span class="diff-add"> The first bullet (about shrinking) shows that when $(X,Y)$ has </span><em><span class="diff-add">any</span></em> <span class="diff-add">circularly symmetric distribution, the conditional variance of $Y|X$ was multiplied by $\left(\sqrt{1-\rho^2}\right)^2 = 1 - \rho^2$.</span></p></li><span class="diff-add">

Because the latter is the negative of the former, both must equal $0$: this term drops out.</span></p><p><strong><span class="diff-add">We have identified the parameter of the skew transformation, $\rho$, as being the correlation coefficient of $X$ and $Y$.</span></strong></p><hr><div class="diff-skipped"><div></div></div><p><span class="diff-delete"> The original circular symmetry</span><span class="diff-add"> By observing that any ellipse may be produced by distorting a circle with a vertical skew transformation that preserves the $x$ coordinate, we have arrived at an understanding</span> of the<span class="diff-delete"> "master" bivariate Normal</span><span class="diff-add"> contours of any</span> distribution<span class="diff-add"> of random variables $(X,Y)$ that is obtained</span> from<span class="diff-delete"> which all other bivariate Normal distributions are derived via</span><span class="diff-add"> a circularly symmetric one by means of stretches, squeezes, rotations, and shifts (that is, any</span> affine<span class="diff-delete"> transformations implies that</span><span class="diff-add"> transformation).

This moves the center of the distribution to the origin and makes all its elliptical contours slant 45 degrees</span> <span class="diff-add">(up or down)</span>.</p><p><span class="diff-add"> When these </span><em><span class="diff-add">standardized</span></em> <span class="diff-add">data form</span> a<span class="diff-add"> circular point cloud,</span> the<span class="diff-add"> regression is easy: the means conditional on $x$ are all $0$, forming a line passing through the origin.  (Circular symmetry implies symmetry with respect to the $x$</span> axis<span class="diff-add">, showing that all conditional distributions are symmetric, whence they have $0$ means.)  As we have seen, we may view the standardized distribution as arising from this basic simple situation in two steps: first, all the (standardized) $y$ values are multiplied by $\sqrt{1-\rho^2}$ for some value of $\rho$; next, all values with $x$-coordinates are vertically skewed by $\rho x$.  What did these distortions do to the regression line (which plots the conditional means against $x$)?</span></p><ul><span class="diff-add">
</span><li><p><span class="diff-add"> The shrinking of $y$ coordinates multiplied all vertical deviations by a constant.  This merely changed the vertical scale and left all conditional means unaltered at $0$.</span></p></li><span class="diff-add">
</span><li><p><span class="diff-add"> The vertical skew transformation added $\rho x$ to all conditional values at $x$, thereby adding $\rho x$ to their conditional mean: the curve $y=\rho x$ is the regression curve, which turns out to be a line.</span></p></li><span class="diff-add">
</span></ul><p><span class="diff-add"> Similarly, we may verify that because the $x$-axis</span> is<span class="diff-add"> the least squares fit to the circularly symmetric distribution, the least squares fit to the transformed distribution also is the line $y=\rho x$: the least-squares line coincides with the regression line.</span></p><p><span class="diff-add"> These beautiful results are a consequence of the fact that the</span> vertical<span class="diff-add"> skew transformation </span><em><span class="diff-add">does not change any $x$ coordinates.</span></em></p><p><span class="diff-add"> We can easily say more:</span></p><ul><span class="diff-add">
</span><li><p><span class="diff-add"> The first bullet (about shrinking) shows that when $(X,Y)$ has </span><em><span class="diff-add">any</span></em> <span class="diff-add">circularly symmetric distribution, the conditional variance of $Y|X$ was multiplied by $\left(\sqrt{1-\rho^2}\right)^2 = 1 - \rho^2$.</span></p></li><span class="diff-add">
</span><li><p><span class="diff-add"> More generally: the vertical skew transformation rescales each conditional distribution by $\sqrt{1-\rho^2}$ and then recenters it by $\rho x$.</span></p></li><span class="diff-add">
</span></ul><p><span class="diff-add"> For</span> the<span class="diff-add"> standard bivariate Normal distribution, the conditional variance</span> is<span class="diff-add"> a constant (equal to $1$), independent of $x$.  We immediately conclude that after applying this skew transformation, the conditional variance of the </span><em><span class="diff-add">vertical deviations</span></em> <span class="diff-add">is still a constant and equals $1-\rho^2$.  Because the conditional distributions of a bivariate Normal are themselves Normal, now that we know their means and variances, we have full information about them</span>.</p><p><strong><span class="diff-add">Finally, we need to relate $\rho$ to the original covariance matrix $\Sigma$.</span></strong>  <span class="diff-add">For this, recall that the (nicest) definition of the correlation coefficient between two </span><em><span class="diff-add">standardized</span></em> <span class="diff-add">variables $X$ and $Y$ is the expectation of their product $XY$.  (The correlation of $X$ and $Y$ is simply declared to be the correlation of their standardized versions.)  Therefore, when $(X,Y)$ follows </span><em><span class="diff-add">any</span></em> <span class="diff-add">circularly symmetric distribution and we apply the skew transformation to the variables, we may write</span></p><p><span class="diff-add"> $$\varepsilon = Y - \rho X$$</span></p><p><span class="diff-add"> for the vertical deviations from the regression line and notice that $\varepsilon$ must have a symmetric distribution around $0$.  Why?  Because </span><em><span class="diff-add">before</span></em> <span class="diff-add">the skew transformation was applied, $Y$ had a symmetric distribution around $0$ and then we (a) squeezed it and (b) lifted it by $\rho X$.  The former did not change its symmetry while the latter recentered it at $\rho X$, QED.  The next figure illustrates this.</span></p><p><img class="diff-add"src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/wOFRD.png" alt="3D plot showing conditional distributions and the least-squares line"></p><p><em><span class="diff-add">The black lines trace out heights proportional to the conditional densities at various regularly-spaced values of $x$.  The thick white line is the regression line, which passes through the center of symmetry of each conditional curve.  This plot shows the case $\rho = -1/2$ in standardized coordinates.</span></em></p><p><span class="diff-add"> Consequently </span></p><p><span class="diff-add"> $$\mathbb{E}(XY) = \mathbb{E}\left(X(\rho X + \varepsilon)\right) = \rho\mathbb{E}(X^2) + \mathbb{E}(X\varepsilon) = \rho(1) + 0=\rho.$$</span></p><p><span class="diff-add"> The final equality is due to two facts: (1) because $X$ has been standardized, the expectation of its square is its standardized variance, equal to $1$ by construction; and (2) the expectation of $X\varepsilon$ equals the expectation of $X(-\varepsilon)$ by virtue of the symmetry of $\varepsilon$. Because the latter is the negative of the former, both must equal $0$: this term drops out.</span></p><p><strong><span class="diff-add">We have identified the parameter of the skew transformation, $\rho$, as being the correlation coefficient of $X$ and $Y$.</span></strong></p><hr><div class="diff-skipped"><div></div></div><p><span class="diff-add"> By observing that any ellipse may be produced by distorting a circle with a vertical skew transformation that preserves the $x$ coordinate, we have arrived at an understanding</span> of the<span class="diff-add"> contours of any</span> distribution<span class="diff-add"> of random variables $(X,Y)$ that is obtained</span> from<span class="diff-add"> a circularly symmetric one by means of stretches, squeezes, rotations, and shifts (that is, any</span> affine<span class="diff-add"> transformation).

</span><li><p><span class="diff-add"> The slope of the regression line in standardized coordinates is the correlation coefficient $\rho$; in the original units it therefore equals $\sigma_y \rho / \sigma_x$.</span></p></li><span class="diff-add">

            <p>The mean formula is a property of ellipses.  Ellipses show up because the bivariate Normal distribution is actually a <em>circularly symmetric distribution</em> that has been distorted in a simple way: namely, by rescaling its axes (separately) and rotating it (an <em>affine transformation</em>).  These facts alone make it intuitively obvious that the conditional expectation of one of the variables <em>must</em> be a linear function of the other variable and that its slope is <em>some</em> function of the coefficients of the covariance matrix $\Sigma$.</p>

<hr>

<h3>About affinely transformed circularly symmetric distributions</h3>

<p>When we re-express the variables $X_1$ and $X_2$ in terms of their standard deviations relative to their means--that is, when we use the variables $Z_i = (X_i - \mu_i)/\sqrt{\sigma_{ii}}$--the conditional distribution should have mean</p>

<p>$$\mathbb{E}(Z_2|Z_1) = \rho Z_1.$$</p>

<p>(I have reversed the variables in order to follow the conventional idea that the second is conditional on the first.)  This fact is what we aim to understand better.</p>

<p>Because it is an affine transformation of the circularly symmetric standard bivariate Normal distribution, the contours of any bivariate Normal distribution must be affine transformations of circles, as shown in this pseudo-3D picture of its density:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/lLwbd.png" alt="Density in 3D"></p>

<p>The $Z_2$ axis is horizontal, the $Z_1$ axes comes out of the screen towards you, and the density axis (not labeled) is more or less "up."</p>

<p>This image has been cut off at $Z_1 = 1$.  The edge of the cut, which forms the front edge of the surface, represents the conditional density $Z_2|\{Z_1=1\}.$  The peak of this edge--where it is highest--is its <em>mode</em>.  However, the symmetry of the Normal distribution implies the mode <em>coincides</em> with its mean.</p>

<h3>Studying conditional expectations</h3>

<p>Let's vary $Z_1$ and keep track of the location of the peak of the conditional density as we do so.  Part of that track is shown by the white path in the figure.  To show how it was constructed, I have created a sequence of several of the cuts as $Z_1$ varied from $1/2$ through $5/2$, displayed as contour maps:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/NAtXv.png" alt="Contours"></p>

<p>In each one of these plots, $Z_1$ is on the horizontal axis and $Z_2$ on the vertical.  Colors represent the bivariate Normal density (for $\rho = 1/3$).  The areas of saturated color are inside the contours just touching the peak of the cuts.  The trace of the peaks is the slanted gray line.</p>

<p>Because all these pictures are geometrically similar to each other (relative to the center, shown as a black dot), then <em>necessarily</em> the trace--which passes through the center--must be a straight line.  (Euclid knew how to prove this visually evident fact.)</p>

<h3>Properties of ellipses</h3>

<p>The only question remaining concerns the slope of this line.  Obviously the slope is less than $1:1$, because a line of that slope would coincide with the major axis of the ellipses and the slope of this trace clearly has lesser magnitude.</p>

<p>An affinely transformed circle is--by definition--an ellipse, whence all these contours are ellipses.  Not only that, because they are transformations of a collection of <em>concentric</em> circles, they are concentric, have the same eccentricity, and they share a common major and minor axis.</p>

<p>Notice that the common major axis of the ellipses lies in the $(1,1)$ direction and the minor axis in the $(1,-1)$ direction.  These are <em>principal directions</em> for the bivariate density.  The covariance matrix $\Sigma$ (which in these coordinates has $1$s on the diagonal and $\rho$ off the diagonal) completely determines the common shape of these ellipses.  From this it is relatively straightforward to deduce that the slope is $\rho$ itself.  The calculations have already been carried out in the answer at <a href="http://stats.stackexchange.com/a/9073">http://stats.stackexchange.com/a/9073</a>.  They were simplified there by using a coordinate system in which the major axis is vertical and the minor axis is horizontal.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>The original circular symmetry of the "master" bivariate Normal distribution from which all other bivariate Normal distributions are derived via affine transformations implies that the conditional expectation of one variable with respect to the other must be a linear function and that its slope is determined by the covariance matrix; specifically, by the <em>single</em> parameter $\rho = \sigma_{12}/\sqrt{\sigma_{11}\sigma_{22}}$.  A calculation involving properties of ellipses establishes this slope is $\rho$ itself (when standardized coordinates $(Z_1,Z_2)$ are used). These are all purely geometric consequences and are not special to the bivariate Normal family.</p>
