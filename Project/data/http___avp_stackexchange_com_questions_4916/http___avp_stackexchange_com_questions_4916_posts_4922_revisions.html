I tend to have a separate synth designated as the sub for wobbles and growls so that a sub oscillator within those synths will not distort the others. With non dubstep songs, I try to keep the mid range sounds separate from the typical dubstep sound range by generally not increasing it between 100 and 200hz. This really depends on preference and the specific song. Heck, it could sound great even in a trance song which<span class="diff-delete"> typical</span><span class="diff-add"> typically</span> aren't known for having overly strong bass<span class="diff-delete"> tones</span><span class="diff-add"> levels</span>.</p><div class="diff-skipped"><div></div></div><p><strong>There are also some techniques specifically used in NI Massive.</strong> One is to add a dimension expander effect to do exactly what the name implies.

One thing Skrillex does a lot with some of his signature sounds is use a hardclipper filter to give them more bite and intensity.

Even if you used the exact same filters, effects,<span class="diff-add"> and</span> oscillators in Massive as you did in FM8, it would sound totally different.
