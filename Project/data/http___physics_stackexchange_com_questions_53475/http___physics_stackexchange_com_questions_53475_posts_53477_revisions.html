            <p> The fly does not slam into the windshield because at smaller scales of size, air effectively becomes much more viscous and halts its motion. A fly using a jet pack in a vacuum-filled car would slam into the windshield, however.</p>

<p> Viscosity is a fascinating issue in terms of scale. Paramecia, for example, effectively must drill their way through water, not swim. Another example I find even more surprising is the number of bacteria and viruses living in clouds, which because of their tiny size can stay aloft almost indefinitely. The relatively minute downward pull of gravity is just not enough to pull them out of the air, especially with so many air currents mixing them up.</p>

<p> The more precise way to say all this is that as the average radius $r$ of an object shrinks, its surface area shrinks more slowly than its volume (mass). For example, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere#Surface_area_of_a_sphere" rel="nofollow">surface area of a ball</a> is $A=4{\pi}r^2$, while the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere#Volume_of_a_sphere" rel="nofollow">volume of a ball</a> is $V=\frac{4}{3}{\pi}r^3$. That means that the ratio of surface area to volume for a ball is $\frac{3}{r}$. That starts getting huge in a hurry when $r$ shrinks to the size of, say, a microbe. If you think of objects of that size as having enormous weightless parachutes attached to them, representing their higher surface areas per gram, you can see the problem.</p>

<p> The fly is actually a somewhat intermediate case, I should note. By actual observation, a small fly definitely does not hit the front or back of a car in response to braking or acceleration. If you instead had a horse fly... I'm not so sure. I could easily see the significantly higher mass-to-surface of a horse fly causing it to move under acceleration of a car. And if for some very strange reason you just happened to end up with <a href="http://www.urbantitan.com/10-worlds-weirdest-insects/#attachment_6659" rel="nofollow">this little fellow</a> flying around in your car -- and managed to stay on the road at the same time -- it would without much doubt slam into the front windshield as you wisely braked as hard as you could.</p><span class="diff-add">

            <p> The fly does not slam into the windshield because at smaller scales of size, air effectively becomes much more viscous and halts its motion. A fly using a jet pack in a vacuum-filled car would slam into the windshield, however.</p>

<p> Viscosity is a fascinating issue in terms of scale. Paramecia, for example, effectively must drill their way through water, not swim. Another example I find even more surprising is the number of bacteria and viruses living in clouds, which because of their tiny size can stay aloft almost indefinitely. The relatively minute downward pull of gravity is just not enough to pull them out of the air, especially with so many air currents mixing them up.</p>

<p> The more precise way to say all this is that as the average radius $r$ of an object shrinks, its surface area shrinks more slowly than its volume (mass). For example, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere#Surface_area_of_a_sphere" rel="nofollow">surface<span class="diff-delete"> areas</span><span class="diff-add"> area</span> of a ball</a> is $A=4{\pi}r^2$, while the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere#Volume_of_a_sphere" rel="nofollow">volume of<span class="diff-delete"> the</span> a ball</a> is $V=\frac{4}{3}{\pi}r^3$. That means that the ratio of surface area to volume for a<span class="diff-delete"> sphere</span><span class="diff-add"> ball</span> is $\frac{3}{r}$<span class="diff-delete">, which</span><span class="diff-add">. That</span> starts<span class="diff-delete"> growing</span><span class="diff-add"> getting</span> huge<span class="diff-add"> in a hurry</span> when $r$ shrinks to the size of, say, a microbe. If you think of objects of that size as having enormous<span class="diff-add"> weightless</span> parachutes attached to them, representing their higher surface<span class="diff-delete"> area</span><span class="diff-add"> areas</span> per gram, you can see the problem.</p>

<p> The fly is actually a somewhat intermediate case, I should note. By actual observation, a small fly definitely does not hit the front or back of a car in response to braking or acceleration. If you instead had a horse fly... I'm not so sure. I could easily see the significantly higher mass-to-surface of a horse fly causing it to move under acceleration of a car. And if for some very strange reason you just happened to end up with <a href="http://www.urbantitan.com/10-worlds-weirdest-insects/#attachment_6659" rel="nofollow">this little fellow</a> flying around in your car -- and managed to stay on the road at the same time -- it would without much doubt slam into the front windshield as you wisely braked as hard as you could. </p>
