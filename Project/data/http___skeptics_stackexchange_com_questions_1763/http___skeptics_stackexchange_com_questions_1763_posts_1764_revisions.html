            <p> I gather that the only possible proof would be the Area Number, and the fact that the number (I assume 04X, like mine) is one associated with Connecticut. The underlying assumptions<span class="diff-delete"> Birthers are</span><span class="diff-add"> Taitz is</span> making are that SSN are assigned at birth, and that the Area Number is intimately associated with the state in which you were born.</p>

<p> From the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/ssn/geocard.html" rel="nofollow">Social Security Administration's official site</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> The Area Number is assigned by the
  geographical region. Prior to 1972,
  cards were issued in local Social
  Security offices around the country
  and the Area Number represented the
  State in which the card was issued.
  This did not necessarily have to be
  the State where the applicant lived,
  since a person could apply for their
  card in any Social Security office.
  Since 1972, when SSA began assigning
  SSNs and issuing cards centrally from
  Baltimore, the area number assigned
  has been based on the ZIP code in the
  mailing address provided on the
  application for the original Social
  Security card. The applicant's mailing
  address does not have to be the same
  as their place of residence. Thus, the
  Area Number does not necessarily
  represent the State of residence of
  the applicant, either prior to 1972 or
  since.</p>
  
  <p> Generally, numbers were assigned
  beginning in the northeast and moving
  westward. So people on the east coast
  have the lowest numbers and those on
  the west coast have the highest
  numbers.</p>
  
  <p> Note: One should not make too much of
  the "geographical code." It is not
  meant to be any kind of useable
  geographical information. The
  numbering scheme was designed in 1936
  (before computers) to make it easier
  for SSA to store the applications in
  our files in Baltimore since the files
  were organized by regions as well as
  alphabetically. It was really just a
  bookkeeping device for our own
  internal use and was never intended to
  be anything more than that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> So depending on when President Obama got his SSN the area number could be based on either the office he was at when he applied for it or the return address on his application. Keeping in mind that in the past people didn't necessarily get a SSN until they actually needed it (usually when they got their first job or applied for the draft), there's a good chance that Obama applied for his sometime after 1972, and possibly during the time when he was at Columbia University in New York City. If that's the case a return address in Connecticut is hardly unlikely or suspicious.</p>
