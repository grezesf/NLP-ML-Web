            <p> Telling your community that their ideas are bad is a sure way to make your community hate you. The most important point here is to <strong>make your community feel like they are contributing something to the game</strong> even if their ideas are not remotely feasible. Good responses would most certainly be <em>"Thanks for the feedback!"</em> or <em>"We'll take it on board!"</em>. However I feel that those response are just standard responses that make you think "blah, blah, blah".</p>

<p> The best kind of response to this is something that...</p>

<ol>
<li> Encourages further input</li>
<li> Ensures player that their suggestion will be considered</li>
<li> Provides a positive human response</li>
</ol>

<p> All of these points will go far in building your community. Best<span class="diff-delete"> non-specific</span> example I can think of would be <em>"That's a really interesting idea -<span class="diff-delete"> we'll</span><span class="diff-add"> jetpacks could add a whole new mechanic to the game! We'll</span> present it to the rest of the team<span class="diff-delete">! Thanks!</span><span class="diff-add">.</span>"</em></p>

<p> That being said, you should jump on good suggestions, and <strong>use them as examples</strong>. That way, you can turn it to your advantage and report back to the community - saying <em>"PlayerX suggested this improvement - and we thought it was such a great idea that we'd add it in! Take a look at this screenshot/video etc!"</em> That kind of feedback will do wonders for your popularity.</p>
