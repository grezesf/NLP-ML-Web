Evarist's question was this: Do there exist infinitely many triples of consecutive sums of two squares? The topic actually has an interesting history: In 1903 an anonymous reader submitted the following question to the section Mathematical Questions in the British journal The Educational Times - Find all consecutive triples of sums of two squares. Elementary though non-explicit solutions were submitted by A. J. Champneys Cunningham and two other British academics (The reference is Mathematical Questions 14955. Educ. Times (2) 3 (1903), 41-43.) The Cunningham in question is the same one as the Cunningham project is named after.
