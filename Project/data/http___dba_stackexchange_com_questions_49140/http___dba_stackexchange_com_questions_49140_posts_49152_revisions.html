            <p> I think the answer to this in both yes and no. You said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> This is a greenfield deployment so there is no existing data to be
  migrated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> If this is an initial deployment then I see no issue with taking a backup of a development database to use in production. Saying that, you (or hopefully your DBA) would obviously have to cleanse the database and remove any security users and other gubbins that might have been restored with the database backup. </p>

<p><strong>However:</strong></p>

<p> As a long term solution, no, this is not a good deployment technique as once a client has started using the database, they will have their data in there so you cannot restore your database over theirs.</p>

<p> So going back to the initial deploy, it's fine to restore a backup of an empty database, but this is the point at which you would start to use version control to manage updates and future deployment, thus maintaining a clean deployable version of the database.</p>

<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li> Create your clean database (restored from a backup if needs be)</li>
<li> Version control it at this point</li>
<li> Script any updates to the database and version control them</li>
<li> When a new version/release is ready to deploy, execute any new scripts against clean database to get it from version X to version Y and then update the version you have in source control.</li>
<li><span class="diff-add"> Finally, you would execute the scripts against the client database to update it.</span></li><span class="diff-add">
</span></ol>

<p> Any updates you make to the database would be tested locally before deployment and updating a client database would simply be a case of running the scripts that gets them from one version to another. Source control would give you the history between clean versions of the database along with the scripts that were applied.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> This is a greenfield deployment so there is no existing data to be

</blockquote>

<p> If this is an initial deployment then I see no issue with taking a backup of a development database to use in production. Saying that, you would obviously have to cleanse the database and remove any security users and other gubbins that might have been restored with the database backup. </p>

<p><strong>However:</strong></p>

<p> As a long term solution, no, this is not a good deployment technique as once a client has started using the database, they will have their data in there so you cannot restore your database over theirs.</p>

<p> So going back to the initial deploy, it's fine to restore a backup of an empty database, but this is the point at which you would start to use version control to manage updates and future deployment, thus maintaining a clean deployable version of the database.</p>

<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li> Create your clean database (restored from a backup if needs be)</li>
<li> Version control it at this point</li>
<li> Script any updates to the database and version control them</li>
</ol>

<p> Any updates you make to the database would be tested locally before deployment and updating a client database would simply be a case of running the scripts that gets them from one version to another.</p>
