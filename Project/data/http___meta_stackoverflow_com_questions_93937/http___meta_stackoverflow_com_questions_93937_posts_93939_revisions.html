            <p> I've thought about the same thing often. Answering lazy questions enables <a href="http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/" rel="nofollow">help vampire</a> behaviour and is usually counter-productive. If their lazy request finds a good answer, they will come back with the next lazy request because they learned they can get away with it.  </p>

<p> Still, <em>discouraging</em> users from answering those questions feels against the spirit of SO. If a user feels called upon to answer what we think is a lazy-ass question, who are we to stop them? </p>

<p> To me, the only thing that is okay to do is to place a <em>calm, polite</em> comment saying something to the effect of "At the moment, there's nothing here than a feature list - please add what you have tried, and where exactly you are stuck." or whatever fits the situation best.</p>

<p> Those comments are <em>incredibly</em> educational. They help establish a culture, and<span class="diff-delete"> educate</span><span class="diff-add"> influence</span> users more than one might think - maybe it's too late for the current question, but users will think twice before asking or answering the next lazy one.</p>

<p> Be <strong>very, very careful</strong> with harsh comments, though. Commenting "we are not going to do your work for you" or similar is too rude and hurtful - most lazy questions are asked in <em>some</em> sort of good faith. Many users simply don't know what to ask because they don't know anything about how things are done. It is usually best to be polite, no matter how aggravating the OP's behaviour is.</p>

            <p> I've thought about the same thing often. Answering lazy questions enables <a href="http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/" rel="nofollow">help vampire</a> behaviour and is usually counter-productive. If their lazy request finds a good answer, they will come back with the next lazy request because they learned they can get away with it.  </p>

<p> Still, <em>discouraging</em> users from answering those questions feels against the spirit of SO. If a user feels called upon to answer what we think is a lazy-ass question, who are we to stop them? </p>

<p> To me, the only thing that is okay to do is to place a <em>calm, polite</em> comment saying something to the effect of "At the moment, there's nothing here than a feature list - please add what you have tried, and where exactly you are stuck." or whatever fits the situation best.</p>

<p> Those comments are <em>incredibly</em> educational. They help establish a culture, and educate users more than one might think - maybe it's too late for the current question, but users will think twice before asking or answering the next lazy one.</p>

<p> Be <strong>very, very careful</strong> with harsh comments, though. Commenting "we are not going to do your work for you" or similar is too rude and hurtful - most lazy questions are asked in <em>some</em> sort of good faith.<span class="diff-add"> Many users simply don't know what to ask because they don't know anything about how things are done.</span> It is usually best to be polite, no matter how aggravating the OP's behaviour is.</p>
