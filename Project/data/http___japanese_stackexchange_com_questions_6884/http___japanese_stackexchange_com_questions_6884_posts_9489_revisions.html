Here's how the 2n+1 number is counted. First fix n. Then, the +1 is for when the word doesn't have an accent. Then if there is an accent the accent can fall on any of the n mora, so +n. However even if there is an accent on any of the n mora, there is always a possible contrast between an initial H tone and an initial L tone, hence the +n is doubled to +2n. Here is an example.

<li> に<b>わ</b>しが   HHL-L</li>

This isn't all the possible permutations of trimoraic words, but it illustrates only the point that needs to be made. Take the last two tonal patterns LHL and HHL. Notice the accent kernel is in the same exact location on those last two words, but yet the tonal melody is not identical. This is because after the accent kernel is identified, there can be two possible tones on the inital mora, either H or L. This is where the 2 comes in for 2n+1. When H is the first tone of the word, the tonal type is said to be an HL type. When L is the first tone of the word the tonal type is called the LHL type. For the Kyoto-Osaka dialect, <i>all<span class="diff-delete"> finite adjectives</span><span class="diff-add"> plain present tense いadjectives</span> are of the HL type, ie all<span class="diff-delete"> いadjectives</span><span class="diff-add"> of them</span> start with H</i>. However there is one consipicious adjective, ええ, for which tonal type is LH eg L-initial.

<li> Every present tense<span class="diff-delete"> adjectives found to have an</span><span class="diff-add"> adjective has no more than one</span> accent kernel<span class="diff-add">.

            <p> I believe so. I can't find an explicit affirmation (I provided sources which I've read before, but I could have forgotten or missed such a statement), but for present tense adjectives in the Kyoto-Osaka dialect, it seems the accent falls on the antepenultimate mora (third to last) for trimoraic words or longer, otherwise it falls on the penultimate mora for bimoraic adjectives. I'm assuming there are no monomoraic adjectives. Although that's a reasonable proposition considering that<span class="diff-add"> non-accentless</span> いadjectives in the Tokyo dialect are completely predictable with the accent kernel on the penultimate mora (eg. あ<b>つ</b>い,うれ<b>し</b>い).
