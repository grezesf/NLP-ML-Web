</span><p> There are different types of morels. I am afraid I cannot advice you on exactly which type is which. The one that is poisonous is very common in Sweden. Its local name is "stone morel", but I have no idea what the variety is called in English. If you want to eat them you have to blanch them several times, cooking them for 5-10 minutes per "round" of blanching. And you need to throw out the water in between the rounds. Merely sauteing them will not kill the poison. Actually, blanching them will not kill the poison either, but most of it will be transferred to the water. </p>

<p> This particular type of morel is actually outlawed in Sweden now. It is that dangerous. This means that they cannot be sold or served at restaurants. However, it is not illegal for individuals to pick them and eat them themselves. Personally I eat them (they are absolutely delicious), but only after having blanched them three times and thrown out the water in between. However, I will <em>never</em> serve them to other people unless I know for sure that they know what they are getting into. </p>

<p> Sadly, the more you blanch them the more you dilute their flavour. But that is just a fact of life. </p>

<p> In other words, you cannot saute them raw. No way. If you absolutely want to eat them, blanch them in lots of water for 5-10 minutes, then throw out the water. Repeat for a total of three blanching rounds. After that you can use them like you would any other mushroom. My recommendation would be to sautee them in lots of butter with a little chopped onion, then adding a splash of amontillado sherry and some cream. Add salt/pepper to taste. Serve the sauce (and yes, it does deserve to be referred to as the main component of the dish) with a nice steak, medium rare, and some kind of potato based side dish. </p>
