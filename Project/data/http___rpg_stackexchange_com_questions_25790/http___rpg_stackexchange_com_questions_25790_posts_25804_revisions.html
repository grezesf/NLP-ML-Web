            <p> Posting this as an answer, to give myself some more room to type.</p>

<p> The stock 7th Sea initiative system seems like it would work well for this.</p>

<p> To summarize the system, for those following along at home:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><span class="diff-delete"> Each</span><span class="diff-add"> Combat is held in </span><em><span class="diff-add">rounds</span></em> <span class="diff-add">of 10 </span><em><span class="diff-add">phases</span></em> <span class="diff-add">each. At the start of each round, each</span> player rolls a number of ten sided dice equal to their Panache rating (1-5), and sets them aside.</p>
  
  <p><span class="diff-delete"> Combat is held in </span><em><span class="diff-delete">rounds</span></em> <span class="diff-delete">of 10 </span><em><span class="diff-delete">phases</span></em> <span class="diff-delete">each</span><span class="diff-add"> Play then proceeds from phase one to phase ten of the round</span>. In order to act on a phase, you discard one of the dice you set aside earlier showing that number or less.</p>
  
  <p> So if you roll: 1, 3, 5 you will generally act three times<span class="diff-delete"> each</span><span class="diff-add"> this</span> round on phases one, three, and five (but may act later).</p>
</blockquote>

<p> Playing the system straight, you'll naturally flow from one player to the next. If you want to really focus on a pair of combatants for a period of time, run them through a round before switching to the other players.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p> Alice (Panache 3) is dueling Bob (Panache 2).</p>

<p> Carlos (Panache 3) is dueling Delilah (Panache 4).</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Run one round of combat (all ten phases) with <strong>just</strong> Alice and Bob. During this round of combat, Alice will act three times and Bob will act twice.</p></li>
<li><p> Run a round of combat with <strong>just</strong> Carlos and Delilah. During this round of combat, Carlos will act three times and Delilah will act four.</p></li>
<li><p> Go back to Alice and Bob. Repeat until the fights resolve themselves.</p></li>
</ul>

<p> In terms of flow, it will look something like this: A, A, B, A, B | C, D, D, C, C, D, D | B, A...</p>

<p> It's possible that a full round of combat will take too long to resolve. If you find this to be the case, you can switch after some number of <em>phases</em> have elapsed, instead of playing a full round. This will let you switch between groups faster, but a player may not have actions in a given set of phases.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p> The same four characters above are fighting. This time combat switches every five phases.</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Run phases one through five for Alice and Bob. Alice will take somewhere between zero and three actions. Bob will take somewhere between zero and two.</p></li>
<li><p> Run phases one through five for Carlos and Delilah. Carlos will take between zero and three actions. Delilah will take between zero and four actions.</p></li>
<li><p> Run phases six through ten for Alice and Bob. Alice and Bob use their remaining actions.</p></li>
<li><p> Run phases six through ten for Carlos and Delilah. Carlos and Delilah use their remaining actions.</p></li>
<li><p> Repeat.</p></li>

            <p> Posting this as an answer, to give myself some more room to type.</p>

<p> The stock 7th Sea initiative system seems like it would work well for this.</p>

<p> To summarize the system, for those following along at home:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> Each player rolls a number of ten sided dice equal to their Panache rating (1-5), and sets them aside.</p>
  
  <p> Combat is held in <em>rounds</em> of 10 <em>phases</em> each. In order to act on a phase, you discard one of the dice you set aside earlier showing that number or less.</p>
  
  <p> So if you roll: 1, 3, 5 you will generally act three times each round on phases one, three, and five (but may act later).</p>
</blockquote>

<p> Playing the system straight, you'll naturally flow from one player to the next. If you want to really focus on a pair of combatants for a period of time, run them through a round before switching to the other players.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p> Alice (Panache 3) is dueling Bob (Panache 2).</p>

<p> Carlos (Panache 3) is dueling Delilah (Panache 4).</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Run one round of combat (all ten phases) with <strong>just</strong> Alice and Bob. During this round of combat, Alice will act three times and Bob will act twice.</p></li>
<li><p> Run a round of combat with <strong>just</strong> Carlos and Delilah. During this round of combat, Carlos will act three times and Delilah will act four.</p></li>
<li><p> Go back to Alice and Bob. Repeat until the fights resolve themselves.</p></li>
</ul>

<p> In terms of flow, it will look something like this: A, A, B, A, B | C, D, D, C, C, D, D | B, A...</p>

<p> It's possible that a full round of combat will take too long to resolve. If you find this to be the case, you can switch after some number of <em>phases</em> have elapsed, instead of playing a full round. This will let you switch between groups faster, but a player may not have actions in a given set of phases.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p> The same four characters above are fighting. This time combat switches every five phases.</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Run phases one through five for Alice and Bob. Alice will take somewhere between zero and three actions. Bob will take somewhere between zero and two.</p></li>
<li><p> Run phases one through five for Carlos and Delilah. Carlos will take between<span class="diff-delete"> one</span><span class="diff-add"> zero</span> and three actions. Delilah will take between zero and four actions.</p></li>
<li><p> Run phases six through ten for Alice and Bob. Alice and Bob use their remaining actions.</p></li>
<li><p> Run phases six through ten for Carlos and Delilah. Carlos and Delilah use their remaining actions.</p></li>
<li><p> Repeat.</p></li>
