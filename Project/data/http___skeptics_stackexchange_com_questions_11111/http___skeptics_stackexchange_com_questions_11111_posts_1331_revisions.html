            <p> I've spent a great deal of effort arguing about the moon landing, and done a great deal of research (the google kind, not the graduate kind) into the claims about the moon landing "hoax." The biggest struggle I've had is that I (obviously) don't possess all the knowledge from every scientist who worked on Apollo, and the person I'm arguing with will normally ask more and more detailed questions until I can't answer them, and they say something like "see? You find out it's a government cover-up if you dig deep enough."</p>

<p> Most of the claims I hear are technical in nature, and are easy to debunk if you can go read about the subject and then follow up with the person (and the person is willing to appeal to fact, which in many cases, is doubtful). Some of the technical claims I hear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li> We could never go to the moon, because it's impossible to send a man through the Van Allen belts</li>
  <li> We could never go to the moon because it would take an absurd amount of energy to keep the astronauts warm</li>
  <li> We could never go to the moon because they couldn't take enough oxygen.</li>
  <li> The president couldn't have made a phone call to Neil Armstrong on the moon.</li>
  <li> We couldn't have broadcast footage live from the moon.</li>
  <li> The flag waved in the wind when they put it on the "moon" and there's no wind on the moon.</li>
  <li> It would have been easier and less expensive to use a sound stage on earth, so that's what they did.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p> All of these are founded on a misunderstanding of some scientific discipline or the other. Most people don't know that the Van Allen belts aren't made of "radiation," but high energy charged particles. Or that the astronauts were plenty warm from being in direct sunlight the entire time, and had to keep cool. </p>

<p> These are supplemented with claims that the US would do <em>anything</em> to win the space race. Since the technical challenges are insurmountable, it follows that the landings were faked in order to win. Of course, the technical challenges aren't insurmountable -- and the evidence that the moon landings are real is overwhelming. </p>

<p> There's a few things that I think are very convincing evidence that the moon landings happened:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li> independent astronomers the world over tracked the command module on its way to and from the moon (eg., <a href="http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/space/apollo.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>)</li>
  <li> all the Apollo missions brought back much more lunar material than has ever been found on earth (<a href="http://planetaryprotection.nasa.gov/missions-past/apollo/" rel="nofollow">382 kg</a>, as opposed to the <a href="http://meteorites.wustl.edu/lunar/moon_meteorites_list_alumina.htm" rel="nofollow">50-ish kg found as meteorites</a>)</li>
