            <p> I enabled two factor authentication with a German number. And since then I'm
locked out of my account: verification SMS never arrive</p>

<p> After setting up two factor authentication, I made a quick test, and it didn't
work. As I still had the settings page open, I created the screen shot below
(phone number edited out). Then I closed that page and hoped for the best. Now
I'm locked out for more than a week, and no reply from Twitter customer
support.</p>

<p> I then read about <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/14226" rel="nofollow">short and long codes</a>. In certain countries, one can send
SMS to a <em>short code</em>, e.g. 40404, and the message get's posted to one's
timeline. Also one can receive tweets to the phone by SMS. In Germany, a short
code is not available, only a <em>long code</em>, +491724403473. Here, receiving
tweets by SMS from Twitter does <em>not work.</em> That makes me to wonder:</p>

<p><em>Could it be that Twitter does not send verification SMS in countries with long
 codes? Could that be the reason why I'm locked out?</em></p>

<p> By the way, using the long code, I can still post to <a href="http://twitter.com/feklee" rel="nofollow">my timeline</a>, although
there were issues in setting that up by SMS, and my password got posted.</p>

            <p> I enabled two factor authentication with a German number. And since then I'm
locked out of my account: verification SMS never arrive</p>

<p> After setting up two factor authentication, I made a quick test, and it didn't
work. As I still had the settings page open, I created the screen shot below
(phone number edited out). Then I closed that page and hoped for the best. Now
I'm locked out for more than a week, and no reply from Twitter customer
support.</p>

<p> I then read about <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/14226" rel="nofollow">short and long codes</a>. In certain countries, one can send
SMS to a <em>short code</em>, e.g. 40404, and the message get's posted to one's
timeline. Also one can receive tweets to the phone by SMS. In Germany, a short
code is not available, only a <em>long code</em>, +491724403473. Here, receiving
tweets by SMS from Twitter does <em>not work.</em> That makes me to wonder:</p>

<p><em>Could it be that Twitter does not send verification SMS in countries with long
 codes? Could that be the reason why I'm locked out?</em></p>

<p> By the way, using the long code, I can still post to <a href="http://twitter.com/feklee" rel="nofollow">my timeline</a>, although
there were issues in setting that up by SMS, and my password got posted.</p>
