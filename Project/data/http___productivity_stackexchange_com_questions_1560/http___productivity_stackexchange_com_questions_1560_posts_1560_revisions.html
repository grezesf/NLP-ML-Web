<blockquote>
  <p> When strain is placed on the spine, the spinal disks start to move and
  misalign. At a 90-degree sitting position, this movement was most
  prominent. The disks were least moved when subjects were sitting back
  at a 135-degree sitting position.</p>
  
  <p> "We have to do something that is similar to the lying position,"
  Bashir told LiveScience. Lying down in a relaxed position with your
  knees slightly bent is the best position that a person can be in,
  because it doesn't cause any stress on the ligaments, the thigh
  muscles as well as on the back.</p>
  
  <p> Sitting on a chair that provides proper support, such as a slightly
  tilted back car seat, can mimic the relaxed supine position. Slouching
  caused a reduction in the spinal height which means that there was
  high rate of wear and tear in the lowest two spinal levels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> But it's a single 2006 research study. I tried leaning back and it seemed to trigger lower back pain. And also - it seems that everyone recommends lumbar rolls, but lumbar rolls would make it more difficult to lean back, unless you have a chair that allows you to recline</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> Reclining backward at a 135 degree seat angle may be "the best biomechanical sitting 
  position" for the back as claimed by the
  research, but it isn't for the neck. A person sitting at a 135 degree
  seat angle must counter-recline their head and neck forward at a 45
  degree angle to look straight ahead as one is required to do when
  working in a seated position. Dr. Bashir said "Sitting in a sound
  anatomic position is essential, since the strain put on the spine and
  its associated ligaments over time can lead to pain, deformity and
  chronic illness." I think pain, deformity and chronic illness is
  exactly what you'll get in your upper back and neck if you sit
  reclining backward at a 135 degree seat angle.</p>
