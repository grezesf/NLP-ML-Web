  <p> The existing record is held by Yasuhiro Kubo (Japan), who jumped from
  a plane at an altitude of 3,000 m. (9,842 ft) without a parachute and
  in 50 seconds hooked onto a parachute which was thrown out prior to

<p> There is a significative difference with the only working reference in the wikipedia article (and most of the stories about this on the net). He did not wait for 50 seconds before launching, but he caught (and deployed?) the parachute 50 seconds after the launch. </p>

<p> As Trupa, a former skydiver said (conversions in square brackets mine): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p> Skydiver's rule of thumb:</p>
  
  <p> 15 seconds to terminal velocity covering 1500 feet [457m] of altitude. Then
  at 120 mph [193kM/h] terminal velocity, 6 seconds per thousand feet [304m]. </p>
  
  <p> So, for 50 seconds:</p>
  
  <p> 50 = 15 + 35 (let's say 36 to make life easy)</p>
  
  <p> = 1500 feet [457m] + 6x1000 feet [304m]</p>
  
  <p> = 7500 feet [2286m]. From 10,000 [3048m] you're at 2500 feet [762m], and minimum allowed opening altitude is 2200 feet [670m].</p>
  
  <p> Now the rig free-falling alone won't fall as fast as a man, so the
  chaser won't have to fall for 50 seconds to catch it. but given the
  time required to put on the harness (2 thigh straps, the shoulder
  straps, and 1 chest strap) let alone the time to chase &amp; catch it, and
  I say you run out of time more often than not from 10000 feet [3048m]. From
  14000 [4267m], maybe you have an even chance. It's still heads you die, tails
  you live.</p>

  time required to put on the harness (2 thigh straps, the shoulder
  straps, and 1 chest strap) let alone the time to chase &amp; catch it, and
  I say you run out of time more often than not from 10000 feet [3048m]. From

  <p> Skydiver's rule of thumb:</p>
  
  <p> 15 seconds to terminal velocity covering 1500 feet [457m] of altitude. Then
  at 120 mph [193kM/h] terminal velocity, 6 seconds per thousand feet [304m]. </p>
  
  <p> So, for 50 seconds:</p>
  
  <p> 50 = 15 + 35 (let's say 36 to make life easy)</p>
  
  <p> = 1500 feet [457m] + 6x1000 feet [304m]</p>
  
  <p> = 7500 feet [2286m]. From 10,000 [3048m] you're at 2500 feet [762m], and minimum allowed opening altitude is 2200 feet [670m].</p>
  
  <p> Now the rig free-falling alone won't fall as fast as a man, so the
  chaser won't have to fall for 50 seconds to catch it. but given the
  time required to put on the harness (2 thigh straps, the shoulder
  straps, and 1 chest strap) let alone the time to chase &amp; catch it, and

  <p> The record for “longest banzai skydive” is indeed monitored in our

  <p> The existing record is held by Yasuhiro Kubo (Japan), who jumped from
  a plane at an altitude of 3,000 m. (9,842 ft) without a parachute and
  in 50 seconds hooked onto a parachute which was thrown out prior to
  his jump on 2 September 2000 in Davis, California, USA.</p>

<p> There is a significative difference with some of the references in the wikipedia article. He did not wait for 50 seconds before launching, but he caught (and deployed?) the parachute 50 seconds after the launch. As Trupa, a former skydiver said : </p>

<blockquote>
  <p> Skydiver's rule of thumb:</p>
  
  <p> 15 seconds to terminal velocity covering 1500 feet of altitude. Then
  at 120 mph terminal velocity, 6 seconds per thousand feet. </p>
  
  <p> So, for 50 seconds:</p>
  
  <p> 50 = 15 + 35 (let's say 36 to make life easy)</p>
  
  <p> = 1500 feet + 6x1000 feet</p>
  
  <p> = 7500 feet. From 10,000 you're at 2500 feet, and minimum allowed opening altitude is 2200 feet.</p>
  
  <p> Now the rig free-falling alone won't fall as fast as a man, so the
  chaser won't have to fall for 50 seconds to catch it. but given the
  time required to put on the harness (2 thigh straps, the shoulder
  straps, and 1 chest strap) let alone the time to chase &amp; catch it, and
  I say you run out of time more often than not from 10000 feet. From
  14000, maybe you have an even chance. It's still heads you die, tails
  you live.</p>
