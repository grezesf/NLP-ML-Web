            <p><span class="diff-add"> You have asked </span><strong><em><span class="diff-add">two</span></em></strong> <span class="diff-add">questions.</span></p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">First</span></strong></p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><span class="diff-add"> "What is the measurement of the G-string that you should use on your Epiphone Les Paul guitar?"</span></p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p> The correct technical term for what you call the "width" or "thickness" or "diameter" of the string is its <strong><em>gauge</em></strong>.</p>

<p> Take your guitar to a qualified guitar technician or luthier, or at least to your local music store, and have them examine the guitar. They can use a measuring device to tell you the exact gauge of strings that are on the guitar, or they can simply estimate it by looking at the strings. They can recommend what set of six strings you should purchase to replace the strings that are on your guitar now. They can also sell you individual strings if you don't need to replace all six.</p>

<p> Epiphone Les Pauls usually ship from the factory with a "set of 10s", which is to say a set of strings where the highest string is 0.010 inches in diameter, and the other five strings make up a matched set of gauges that work well with the 0.010-inch string.</p>

<p> Different sets of strings sold by different manufacturers will vary in the gauge of each individual string, but typically an Epiphone Les Paul would come from the factory with a G-string that is unwound and is 0.017 inches in diameter.</p>

<p> For example, below, I have provided a screen shot of a chart showing the standard string gauge specifications in a set of Gibson Brite Wires nickel-plated steel round-wound strings. This is a popular set of string gauges for a Les Paul-style guitar.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8tNgx.png" alt="enter image description here"></p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">Second</span></strong></p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><span class="diff-add"> you asked "So how does string gauge affect intonation?"</span></p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><span class="diff-add"> It is not so much a question of the string gauge affecting the intonation. Rather, it is that a guitar requires several different types of adjustment in </span><em><span class="diff-add">calibration</span></em> <span class="diff-add">to work correctly if you decide that you would rather play with heavier strings or lighter strings. Adjusting the position of the bridge saddles is only </span><em><span class="diff-add">one</span></em> <span class="diff-add">of these types of calibration. </span></p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><span class="diff-add"> Doing this requires a </span><strong><em><span class="diff-add">professional setup</span></em></strong> <span class="diff-add">(a topic I have written about many times on this site, and something that beginning guitarists seem not to be aware of). If you want to use heavier or lighter-gauge strings on your guitar, you need to take it to a professional guitar technician and pay them (usually between $50 and $150 in the USA, in my experience) to change the calibration of several parts of the guitar, interactively, to work correctly with the heavier or lighter strings to produce proper intonation, to make sure all notes sound clearly, and to make the guitar easy to play (so that the height of the strings from the fingerboard and frets is neither too high nor too low). Adjustments and calibrations need to be made to the </span><em><span class="diff-add">nut</span></em><span class="diff-add">, the neck's </span><em><span class="diff-add">truss rod</span></em><span class="diff-add">, to the calibration and position of several mechanical parts in the </span><em><span class="diff-add">bridge</span></em> <span class="diff-add">(particularly if it is a tremolo bridge like a Fender or Floyd Rose), and in extreme cases the </span><em><span class="diff-add">frets</span></em> <span class="diff-add">or the </span><em><span class="diff-add">fingerboard</span></em> <span class="diff-add">may need to be modified.</span></p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><span class="diff-add"> In short, you are correct that it is simpler to keep the same gauge of strings that are already on the guitar. Going to heavier or lighter-gauge strings would probably change the calibration of the guitar to the extent that it would be wise to pay for a professional setup. However, be advised that from time to time your guitar could benefit from professional maintenance and a setup even if you keep using new sets of the same gauge of strings.

                <p> The correct technical term for what you call the "width" or "thickness" or "diameter" of the string is its <strong><em>gauge</em></strong>.</p>

<p> Take your guitar to a qualified guitar technician or luthier, or at least to your local music store, and have them examine the guitar. They can use a measuring device to tell you the exact gauge of strings that are on the guitar, or they can simply estimate it by looking at the strings. They can recommend what set of six strings you should purchase to replace the strings that are on your guitar now. They can also sell you individual strings if you don't need to replace all six.</p>

<p> Epiphone Les Pauls usually ship from the factory with a "set of 10s", which is to say a set of strings where the highest string is 0.010 inches in diameter, and the other five strings make up a matched set of gauges that work well with the 0.010-inch string.</p>

<p> Different sets of strings sold by different manufacturers will vary in the gauge of each individual string, but typically an Epiphone Les Paul would come from the factory with a G-string that is unwound and is 0.017 inches in diameter.</p>

<p> For example, below, I have provided a screen shot of a chart showing the standard string gauge specifications in a set of Gibson Brite Wires nickel-plated steel round-wound strings. This is a popular set of string gauges for a Les Paul-style guitar.</p>

</span><p><span class="diff-add"> you asked "So how does string gauge affect intonation?"</span></p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><span class="diff-add"> It is not so much a question of the string gauge affecting the intonation. Rather, it is that a guitar requires several different types of adjustment in </span><em><span class="diff-add">calibration</span></em> <span class="diff-add">to work correctly if you decide that you would rather play with heavier strings or lighter strings. Adjusting the position of the bridge saddles is only </span><em><span class="diff-add">one</span></em> <span class="diff-add">of these types of calibration. </span></p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><span class="diff-add"> Doing this requires a </span><strong><em><span class="diff-add">professional setup</span></em></strong> <span class="diff-add">(a topic I have written about many times on this site, and something that beginning guitarists seem not to be aware of). If you want to use heavier or lighter-gauge strings on your guitar, you need to take it to a professional guitar technician and pay them (usually between $50 and $150 in the USA, in my experience) to change the calibration of several parts of the guitar, interactively, to work correctly with the heavier or lighter strings to produce proper intonation, to make sure all notes sound clearly, and to make the guitar easy to play (so that the height of the strings from the fingerboard and frets is neither too high nor too low). Adjustments and calibrations need to be made to the </span><em><span class="diff-add">nut</span></em><span class="diff-add">, the neck's </span><em><span class="diff-add">truss rod</span></em><span class="diff-add">, to the calibration and position of several mechanical parts in the </span><em><span class="diff-add">bridge</span></em> <span class="diff-add">(particularly if it is a tremolo bridge like a Fender or Floyd Rose), and in extreme cases the </span><em><span class="diff-add">frets</span></em> <span class="diff-add">or the </span><em><span class="diff-add">fingerboard</span></em> <span class="diff-add">may need to be modified.</span></p><span class="diff-add">
