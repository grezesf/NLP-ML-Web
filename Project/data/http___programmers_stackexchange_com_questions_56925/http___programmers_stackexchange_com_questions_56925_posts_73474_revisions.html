</span></ol><p><span class="diff-delete"> You can read the full post here: 
</span><a href="http://astonj.com/life/best-way-to-learnreadstudy" rel="nofollow"><span class="diff-delete">http://astonj.com/life/best-way-to-learnreadstudy</span></a></p><blockquote><span class="diff-add">
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> Ok lets get startedâ€¦ but first it should go without saying that the
  â€˜bestâ€™ way to learn is whatever works for you â€“ these are just a
  number of tips that I find help me. Maybe theyâ€™ll help you too.</span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">1. Learn something youâ€™re interested in!</span></strong>   </p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> This oneâ€™s easy. If your heartâ€™s not in it, forget it. We learn best when we have an interest
  in the topic. Of course our reasons for learning something may vary â€“
  you might want to learn something so you donâ€™t have to pay someone
  else to do it, or, because you genuinely like/love whatever it is you
  are learning. The more you like it, the more likely you are to master
  it.</span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">2. Choose your resources wisely</span></strong>   </p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> Finding a topic is the easy part â€“ finding the best material is a bit more tricky. Here, my best advice
  is to play the field. Take a look at whatâ€™s out there, read book
  reviews (look for responses that are passionate), listen to the advice
  of people you trust or who are well respected in their field. Go ahead
  and try things â€“ just because you bought a book, doesnâ€™t mean you have
  to read it. Iâ€™ve bought a few that I started and just didnâ€™t get into.
  Thatâ€™s cool, because when you find a book you really like, you
  appreciate it that much more.</span><br><span class="diff-add">
  Donâ€™t limit yourself to books either,
  screencasts or interactive learning sites (such as Code School,
  Tryruby, etc) are excellent ways to combine all the best ways of
  learning â€“ watching, reading, doing.</span><br><span class="diff-add">
  Pace yourself. Donâ€™t jump too
  far ahead â€“ donâ€™t be afraid to start from the basicsâ€¦ it may actually
  end up saving you time in the long run.</span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">3. Eat well</span></strong>   </p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> Your body is a complex machine. And machines need fuel, energy, and must be kept in good working order â€“ i.e. donâ€™t screw up
  your body by eating shit, doing drugs or wearing poisons on your skin
  because you think they make you smell good, they donâ€™t.</span><br><span class="diff-add">
  I could
  write a book on this topic alone let alone a blog post! But the basics
  are stick to foods that our ancestors would have eaten, that means no
  processed crap, fried foods, sweets, chocolates, breads, pizza, etc.
  Care about how your foods are manufactured/grown too. Think growth
  hormones, steroids, routine antibiotics, in-breeding, poor quality
  feed and conditions is going to rear good healthy stock? Think again. 
  Drink plenty of natural mineral water (not tap, flavoured or
  reconstituted). Dehydration can impact your performance by up to 40%. 
  People go on about bad education for the poor, but you know what?
  Education is only half the story â€“ diet and lifestyle will probably
  have more of a profound effect on your learning ability than whether
  you go to a good school or not.</span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">4. Sleep well</span></strong>   </p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> Your body needs quality sleep. To recuperate, and more importantly, for someone embarking on learning something â€“ sleep is
  when your body indexes everything youâ€™ve done/learned that day. If the
  quality of your sleep is poor, your brain wonâ€™t have been able to
  properly store/index everything you got up to that day properlyâ€¦ so
  all that time you spent reading something? Could well be wasted.</span><br><span class="diff-add">
  Luckily for you, eating clean (see above) will help you sleep well
  too.</span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">5. Get a Kindle</span></strong>  </p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> Forget your iPad or computer screen â€“ they use LCDs which not only give you retina burn because of the ridiculous
  brightness, but because they â€˜refreshâ€™/flicker so many times a second,
  cause eye fatigue. The screen on the Kindle is beautiful. You can read
  it outdoors, indoors, on the bed, in the loo â€“ wherever. Imagine
  reading a huge book in bed, turning over side to side holding the damn
  thing â€“ the bigger the book the less comfy it will be! Now imagine
  five or six similar books you have to get through â€“ not great really.
  Enter the Kindle. Itâ€™s light, easy, perfect. I love mine, wouldnâ€™t be
  without it now. They also allow you to highlight text and if you buy
  an e-book from Amazon you can view â€˜popular highlightsâ€™ too â€“ which is
  a great way to see what your peers think is important or worth noting.</span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">6. Read last thing at night</span></strong>  </p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> Can you remember what you did first thing yesterday morning? Nope neither can I! I bet you can remember
  what you did last night though. And thereâ€™s a good reason for that â€“
  because of the way your brain works. It starts indexing in descending
  order, so what you did last, gets indexed/stored first. Try it. Read
  something in the morning, and something in the night â€“ the following
  day see which you remembered best.</span><br><span class="diff-add">
  Hear that? Another good reason to
  read at night is for the peace and quiet. Thereâ€™s nothing worse than
  distractions, whether itâ€™s traffic, kids playing, or the general
  ambiance of people hovering around â€“ and although you might not
  notice, your subconscious will. I find I can concentrate much better
  at night, when the pets are asleep, phones are not ringing and the
  rest of the neighboured is tucked in for the night!</span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">7. Donâ€™t get ahead of yourself</span></strong>  </p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> Or rather, donâ€™t be afraid to take a step back. If youâ€™re reading something that you just donâ€™t get, put it
  down for the time being and get a book that tackles the basics, or is
  a step down from what you were reading. If you â€˜getâ€™ this new book and
  then go back to the other book and still donâ€™t get it, do the same
  again â€“ put it down and find another book that covers something
  simpler. Trust me you wonâ€™t be wasting your time â€“ repeating is
  reinforcing. So even if youâ€™ve covered the topic before, going over it
  again will still be highly beneficial. </span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> If you just canâ€™t get into the book that you kept putting down, maybe
  it wasnâ€™t a good choice â€“ find an alternative that covers the same
  material, waste no more time on it or come back to it later as a
  bonus.</span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">8. Canâ€™t concentrate? Breatheâ€¦</span></strong>   </p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> Sometimes youâ€™ll have things buzzing around your head. Sometimes it will take a while for your eyes to
  adjust from a flickering LCD to the solid tranquillity of ink (digital
  or otherwise!). When you find your mind running away, close your eyes
  and slowly count to 10. Repeat if necessary. It works.   (Make sure
  you are drinking enough water too â€“ as that can effect concentration.)</span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">9. Listen to music before you get started</span></strong>  </p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> Not during â€“ although some people are ok with that. Scientists have proven that listening to
  music before a task such as learning, helps you concentrate better.
  The type of music doesnâ€™t matter, so long as you enjoy it. Now you can
  tell your parents/partners that thereâ€™s a good reason why you have the
  music on so loud!</span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">10. Make notes and go over things</span></strong>  </p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> Whatever you do, be sure to go over things. Whether youâ€™re the sort of person who likes making notes,
  highlighting in your Kindle, or just re-reading whole books, make a
  point to go over what youâ€™ve studied because this will help reinforce
  what youâ€™ve learnt.</span><br><span class="diff-add">
  I used to make notes, but since getting my
  Kindle I highlight snippets (or sometimes even a few pages at a time)
  then after reading another book I go over the highlights of the
  previous book. So I get a chance to begin to forget, then remember
  again.</span><br><span class="diff-add">
  I also re-read or plan to re-read my favourite books, partly
  because I enjoyed them and partly to see how much Iâ€™ve forgotten lol.
  (Just kidding!)</span><br><span class="diff-add">
  Also, as mentioned before, donâ€™t be afraid to get
  two books that are aimed at the same level â€“ repeating is reinforcing.
  Repeating isâ€¦? </span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">Bonus tip. Enjoy yourself!</span></strong> </p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> Whatever you do, when it
  starts to get boring or feels like a chore â€“ stop. Keep things
  interesting, fun and pace yourself so you feel like youâ€™re achieving
  stuff. Itâ€™s one of the reasons why I tend to get at least two books
  that deal with the same level of whatever it is I am learning â€“ when
  you read the other book you often catch yourself thinking â€˜I know

                <p><span class="diff-add"> Diet</span> and sleep - things which IMO, are fundamental to how well you pick up things.</p><p> Here's a <a href="http://astonj.com/life/best-way-to-learnreadstudy/" rel="nofollow"><span class="diff-add">list and explanations from my blog</span></a> :<span class="diff-add">&nbsp; </span></p><blockquote><span class="diff-add">
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> Ok lets get startedâ€¦ but first it should go without saying that the
  â€˜bestâ€™ way to learn is whatever works for you â€“ these are just a
  number of tips that I find help me. Maybe theyâ€™ll help you too.</span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">1. Learn something youâ€™re interested in!</span></strong>   </p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> This oneâ€™s easy. If your heartâ€™s not in it, forget it. We learn best when we have an interest
  in the topic. Of course our reasons for learning something may vary â€“
  you might want to learn something so you donâ€™t have to pay someone
  else to do it, or, because you genuinely like/love whatever it is you
  are learning. The more you like it, the more likely you are to master
  it.</span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">2. Choose your resources wisely</span></strong>   </p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> Finding a topic is the easy part â€“ finding the best material is a bit more tricky. Here, my best advice
  is to play the field. Take a look at whatâ€™s out there, read book
  reviews (look for responses that are passionate), listen to the advice
  of people you trust or who are well respected in their field. Go ahead
  and try things â€“ just because you bought a book, doesnâ€™t mean you have
  to read it. Iâ€™ve bought a few that I started and just didnâ€™t get into.
  Thatâ€™s cool, because when you find a book you really like, you
  appreciate it that much more.</span><br><span class="diff-add">
  Donâ€™t limit yourself to books either,
  screencasts or interactive learning sites (such as Code School,
  Tryruby, etc) are excellent ways to combine all the best ways of
  learning â€“ watching, reading, doing.</span><br><span class="diff-add">
  Pace yourself. Donâ€™t jump too
  far ahead â€“ donâ€™t be afraid to start from the basicsâ€¦ it may actually
  end up saving you time in the long run.</span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">3. Eat well</span></strong>   </p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> Your body is a complex machine. And machines need fuel, energy, and must be kept in good working order â€“ i.e. donâ€™t screw up
  your body by eating shit, doing drugs or wearing poisons on your skin
  because you think they make you smell good, they donâ€™t.</span><br><span class="diff-add">
  I could
  write a book on this topic alone let alone a blog post! But the basics
  are stick to foods that our ancestors would have eaten, that means no
  processed crap, fried foods, sweets, chocolates, breads, pizza, etc.
  Care about how your foods are manufactured/grown too. Think growth
  hormones, steroids, routine antibiotics, in-breeding, poor quality
  feed and conditions is going to rear good healthy stock? Think again. 
  Drink plenty of natural mineral water (not tap, flavoured or
  reconstituted). Dehydration can impact your performance by up to 40%. 
  People go on about bad education for the poor, but you know what?
  Education is only half the story â€“ diet and lifestyle will probably
  have more of a profound effect on your learning ability than whether
  you go to a good school or not.</span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">4. Sleep well</span></strong>   </p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> Your body needs quality sleep. To recuperate, and more importantly, for someone embarking on learning something â€“ sleep is
  when your body indexes everything youâ€™ve done/learned that day. If the
  quality of your sleep is poor, your brain wonâ€™t have been able to
  properly store/index everything you got up to that day properlyâ€¦ so
  all that time you spent reading something? Could well be wasted.</span><br><span class="diff-add">
  Luckily for you, eating clean (see above) will help you sleep well
  too.</span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">5. Get a Kindle</span></strong>  </p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> Forget your iPad or computer screen â€“ they use LCDs which not only give you retina burn because of the ridiculous
  brightness, but because they â€˜refreshâ€™/flicker so many times a second,
  cause eye fatigue. The screen on the Kindle is beautiful. You can read
  it outdoors, indoors, on the bed, in the loo â€“ wherever. Imagine
  reading a huge book in bed, turning over side to side holding the damn
  thing â€“ the bigger the book the less comfy it will be! Now imagine
  five or six similar books you have to get through â€“ not great really.
  Enter the Kindle. Itâ€™s light, easy, perfect. I love mine, wouldnâ€™t be
  without it now. They also allow you to highlight text and if you buy
  an e-book from Amazon you can view â€˜popular highlightsâ€™ too â€“ which is
  a great way to see what your peers think is important or worth noting.</span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">6. Read last thing at night</span></strong>  </p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> Can you remember what you did first thing yesterday morning? Nope neither can I! I bet you can remember
  what you did last night though. And thereâ€™s a good reason for that â€“
  because of the way your brain works. It starts indexing in descending
  order, so what you did last, gets indexed/stored first. Try it. Read
  something in the morning, and something in the night â€“ the following
  day see which you remembered best.</span><br><span class="diff-add">
  Hear that? Another good reason to
  read at night is for the peace and quiet. Thereâ€™s nothing worse than
  distractions, whether itâ€™s traffic, kids playing, or the general
  ambiance of people hovering around â€“ and although you might not
  notice, your subconscious will. I find I can concentrate much better
  at night, when the pets are asleep, phones are not ringing and the
  rest of the neighboured is tucked in for the night!</span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">7. Donâ€™t get ahead of yourself</span></strong>  </p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> Or rather, donâ€™t be afraid to take a step back. If youâ€™re reading something that you just donâ€™t get, put it
  down for the time being and get a book that tackles the basics, or is
  a step down from what you were reading. If you â€˜getâ€™ this new book and
  then go back to the other book and still donâ€™t get it, do the same
  again â€“ put it down and find another book that covers something
  simpler. Trust me you wonâ€™t be wasting your time â€“ repeating is
  reinforcing. So even if youâ€™ve covered the topic before, going over it
  again will still be highly beneficial. </span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> If you just canâ€™t get into the book that you kept putting down, maybe
  it wasnâ€™t a good choice â€“ find an alternative that covers the same
  material, waste no more time on it or come back to it later as a
  bonus.</span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">8. Canâ€™t concentrate? Breatheâ€¦</span></strong>   </p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> Sometimes youâ€™ll have things buzzing around your head. Sometimes it will take a while for your eyes to
  adjust from a flickering LCD to the solid tranquillity of ink (digital
  or otherwise!). When you find your mind running away, close your eyes
  and slowly count to 10. Repeat if necessary. It works.   (Make sure
  you are drinking enough water too â€“ as that can effect concentration.)</span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">9. Listen to music before you get started</span></strong>  </p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> Not during â€“ although some people are ok with that. Scientists have proven that listening to
  music before a task such as learning, helps you concentrate better.
  The type of music doesnâ€™t matter, so long as you enjoy it. Now you can
  tell your parents/partners that thereâ€™s a good reason why you have the
  music on so loud!</span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">10. Make notes and go over things</span></strong>  </p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> Whatever you do, be sure to go over things. Whether youâ€™re the sort of person who likes making notes,
  highlighting in your Kindle, or just re-reading whole books, make a
  point to go over what youâ€™ve studied because this will help reinforce
  what youâ€™ve learnt.</span><br><span class="diff-add">
  I used to make notes, but since getting my
  Kindle I highlight snippets (or sometimes even a few pages at a time)
  then after reading another book I go over the highlights of the
  previous book. So I get a chance to begin to forget, then remember
  again.</span><br><span class="diff-add">
  I also re-read or plan to re-read my favourite books, partly
  because I enjoyed them and partly to see how much Iâ€™ve forgotten lol.
  (Just kidding!)</span><br><span class="diff-add">
  Also, as mentioned before, donâ€™t be afraid to get
  two books that are aimed at the same level â€“ repeating is reinforcing.
  Repeating isâ€¦? </span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">Bonus tip. Enjoy yourself!</span></strong> </p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> Whatever you do, when it
  starts to get boring or feels like a chore â€“ stop. Keep things
  interesting, fun and pace yourself so you feel like youâ€™re achieving
  stuff. Itâ€™s one of the reasons why I tend to get at least two books
  that deal with the same level of whatever it is I am learning â€“ when
  you read the other book you often catch yourself thinking â€˜I know
  that!â€™ and itâ€™s moments like that that give you a buzz and remind you
  that you are actually learning something. Little achievements like
  that give you the incentive and will to carry on.</span></p><span class="diff-add">
