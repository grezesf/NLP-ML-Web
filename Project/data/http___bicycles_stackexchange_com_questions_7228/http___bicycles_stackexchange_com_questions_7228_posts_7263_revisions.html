            <p> This is a really good question, and one that I found myself asking only a few weeks ago. The aforementioned posts are great if you feel like restricting yourself to "Goretex" as the main construction fabric of the jacket you're looking for. 
You can find a lot of technical information about Goretex online, but one of the most basic facts about the fabric is its 3,000mm rating. This means that, technically, the fabric isn't 100% waterproof, but is, rather, "rain proof." As found here - <a href="http://backcountrybeacon.com/2010/04/waterproof-ratings-demystified/" rel="nofollow">http://backcountrybeacon.com/2010/04/waterproof-ratings-demystified/</a> - you'll be able to see what I mean. </p>

<p> If you're open to discovering new jackets and fabrics, I would suggest looking beyond conventional Goretex jackets and taking a look at several retailers that are currently constructing jackets using<span class="diff-delete"> Polartec's new NeoShell fabric</span> <span class="diff-delete">- </span><a href="http://www.polartec.com/neoshell/technical-highlights.aspx" rel="nofollow"><span class="diff-delete">http://www.polartec.com/neoshell/technical-highlights.aspx</span><span class="diff-add">Polartec's new NeoShell fabric</span></a>.

Oh, another thing, NeoShell works as a passive membrane check this out - </p>

<p> Goretex is an active permeable fabric, what this means is that you'll need to start sweating and building pressure within the jacket before you notice any dissipation of heat through the fabric, relieving you of excess heat (but at this point it's kind of too late). SUCKS!</p>

<p> NeoShell is a passive permeable fabric, what this means is that the second you start to build up heat pressure in the jacket it is basically forced out. Pretty cool huh? It gets better...</p>

<p> I've been itching to write this review somewhere and a friend of mine JUST referred this site as a great resource for biking gear. So I got the jacket last Sunday and have been riding, running, and pushing myself harder than I ever could with my old riding jackets (which were all pearlIzumi, etc). I've got a similar commute to handle every morning in<span class="diff-delete"> 19</span><span class="diff-add"> 19F (-7C)</span> degree weather and the first time I got out on Monday and started to feel the heat in my jacket, it was as if it was being sucked out, leaving me with an even warmth that was comfortable and inspired me to ride even harder. The jacket has a great articulated hood, loooooong sleeves with asymmetrical cuffs that cover the tops of your hands from the wind, draw cords on the waist, and pockets that double as vents. It has a fleece lining to wick moisture. And because the fabric is so breathable, I've never had to unzip to regulate heat. Literally... the best riding jacket that was never meant to be a riding jacket. 100% wind and waterproof. It's a little pricey, but for something that can do what all others cannot AND be used for running, skiing, hiking, and climbing... it really doesn't get much better. I have yet to brave snow, but I've never been this excited to conquer terrible weather in my life.</p>

<p> I would recommend a baselayer and something warm on those extra cold days. Hope this helps!</p>

            <p> This is a really good question, and one that I found myself asking only a few weeks ago. The aforementioned posts are great if you feel like restricting yourself to "Goretex" as the main construction fabric of the jacket you're looking for. 
You can find a lot of technical information about Goretex online, but one of the most basic facts about the fabric is its 3,000mm rating. This means that, technically, the fabric isn't 100% waterproof, but is, rather, "rain proof." As found here - <a href="http://backcountrybeacon.com/2010/04/waterproof-ratings-demystified/" rel="nofollow">http://backcountrybeacon.com/2010/04/waterproof-ratings-demystified/</a> - you'll be able to see what I mean. </p>

<p> If you're open to discovering new jackets and fabrics, I would suggest looking beyond conventional Goretex jackets and taking a look at several retailers that are currently constructing jackets using Polartec's new NeoShell fabric - <a href="http://www.polartec.com/neoshell/technical-highlights.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.polartec.com/neoshell/technical-highlights.aspx</a>. Marmot released their ZION (<a href="http://marmot.com/products/zion_jacket_fall_2011" rel="nofollow">http://marmot.com/products/zion_jacket_fall_2011</a>) jacket using NeoShell, which is rated at 10,000mm (100% waterproof by all industrial standards) and has received awards from Polartec for best use of their fabric. And so, after a heavy amount of research (really the only reason I know any of this), I decided to purchase one from a 3rd party retailer for quite a bit less than they are found on the site. Oh, another thing, NeoShell works as a passive membrane check this out - </p>

<p> Goretex is an active permeable fabric, what this means is that you'll need to start sweating and building pressure within the jacket before you notice any dissipation of heat through the fabric, relieving you of excess heat (but at this point it's kind of too late). SUCKS!</p>

<p> NeoShell is a passive permeable fabric, what this means is that the second you start to build up heat pressure in the jacket it is basically forced out. Pretty cool huh? It gets better...</p>

<p> I've been itching to write this review somewhere and a friend of mine JUST referred this site as a great resource for biking gear. So I got the jacket last Sunday and have been riding, running, and pushing myself harder than I ever could with my old riding jackets (which were all pearlIzumi, etc). I've got a similar commute to handle every morning in 19 degree weather and the first time I got out on Monday and started to feel the heat in my jacket, it was as if it was being sucked out, leaving me with an even warmth that was comfortable and inspired me to ride even harder. The jacket has a great articulated hood, loooooong sleeves with asymmetrical cuffs that cover the tops of your hands from the wind, draw cords on the waist, and pockets that double as vents.<span class="diff-add"> It has a fleece lining to wick moisture. And because the fabric is so breathable, I've never had to unzip to regulate heat.</span> Literally... the best riding jacket that was never meant to be a riding jacket<span class="diff-add">. 100% wind and waterproof</span>. It's a little pricey, but for something that can do what all others cannot AND be used for running, skiing, hiking, and climbing... it really doesn't get much better. I have yet to brave snow, but I've never been this excited to conquer terrible weather in my life.</p>

<p> I would recommend a baselayer and something warm on those extra cold days. Hope this helps!</p>
