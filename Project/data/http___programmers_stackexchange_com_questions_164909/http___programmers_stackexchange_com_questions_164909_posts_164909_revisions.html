            <h3>History</h3>

<p> We are currently using a so called redirect model for our online payments (where you send the payer to a payment gateway, where he inputs his payment details - the gateway will then return him to a success/failure callback page). That's easy and straight-forward, but unfortunately quite inconvenient and at times confusing for our customers (leaving the site, changing their credit card details with an additional login on another site etc).</p>

<h3>Intention &amp; Problem description</h3>

<p> We are now intending to switch to an integrated approach using an exchange of XML requests and responses. My problem is on how to cater with all (or rather most) of the things that may happen during processing - bearing in mind that normally simplicity is robust whereas complexity is fragile. </p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<ul>
<li> User abort: The user inputs Credit Card details and hits submit. An XML message to the provider's gateway is sent and waiting for response. The user hits "stop" in his browser or closes the window.
<ul>
<li> ignore_user_abort() in PHP may be an option - but is that reliable?</li>
<li> might it be better to redirect the user to a "please wait"-page, that in turn opens an AJAX or other request to the actual processor that does not rely on the connection? </li>
</ul></li>
<li> Database goes away
<ul>
<li> sounds over-complicated, but with e.g. a webserver in the States and a DB in the UK, it has happened and will happen again: User clicks together his order, payment request has been sent to the provider but the response cannot be stored in the database. What approach could I use, using PHP to sort of start an SQL like "Transaction" that only at the very end gets committed or rolled back, depending on the individual steps? Should then neither commit or roll back have happened, I could sort of "lock" the user to prevent him from paying again or to improperly account for payments - but how?</li>
</ul></li>
<li> And what else do I need to consider technically? None of the integration examples of e.g. Worldpay, Realex or SagePay offer any insight, and<span class="diff-delete"> neither Google</span><span class="diff-add"> either my search engine</span> or my search terms<span class="diff-delete"> were</span><span class="diff-add"> weren't</span> good enough to find somebody else's thoughts on this.</li>
</ul>

<p> Thank you very much for any insight on how you would approach this!</p>
