            <p> PGP works well to provide many key aspects of information security; message confidentiality and integrity, sender and recipient authenticity, and sender non-repudiation (the sender, who has digitally signed the message using their own private key, cannot claim that they did not in fact send the e-mail). However, one thing it doesn't seem to provide is <em>recipient non-repudiation</em>; the recipient can still claim that they didn't receive the sender's e-mail, when in fact it was received, read and understood.</p>

<p> Most measures in place to provide this are voluntary on the part of the recipient; they can choose to send a "read receipt" to the sender indicating they received the message. These are e-mails, and like any, they can be spoofed unless the<span class="diff-delete"> message</span><span class="diff-add"> receipt</span> is<span class="diff-delete"> in turn encrypted in</span><span class="diff-add"> digitally signed by</span> the<span class="diff-delete"> PGP scheme</span><span class="diff-add"> recipient as the original message was by the sender</span>. Or, the recipient can opt not to send the read receipt. In some cases, some e-mail providers and some e-mail programs/plugins even allow a recipient to send a fake "undeliverable" response to the sender (this is a strategy for fighting spam; by making your address <em>look</em> invalid to the spammer, he's encouraged to remove it from his mailing lists).</p>

<p> So, two questions; first, is there any existing scheme that enforces mandatory recipient non-repudiation measures? And second, if there isn't, what might you posit as a workable solution to provide this as an extension to PGP?</p>

<p> Something I thought of would require third-party participation of some kind. Normally, a PGP -encrypted message includes the symmetric key, encrypted with the recipient's public key, both sent directly to the recipient. What if, instead, that encrypted key were sent to a trusted third party "key holder", such as the sender's "home" e-mail server, along with the recipient's public-key certificate? The key holder can be authenticated with its own public-key certificate, thus also allowing secure communication between all parties including the key holder. Then, the message sent to the recipient would include a "pointer" to the key holder and a nonce identifying the message. </p>

<p> In order to actually read the message, the recipient needs to get the key from the key holder, so the recipient crafts a request for the key, signed with their certificate, and sends it to the key holder. The key holder uses the recipient's certificate (which the sender had provided along with the encrypted message key) to verify that it is the intended recipient asking for the key, and complies. The key holder now has proof that the intended recipient received the message they were asking about and is attempting to read it, and can inform the sender of that fact. This is a pretty strong "read receipt", IMO; you can't prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the message actually was read top to bottom, line by line, and its content understood by the end user, but you can at least prove that you led the horse to water.</p>

            <p> PGP works well to provide many key aspects of information security; message confidentiality and integrity, sender and recipient authenticity, and sender non-repudiation (the sender, who has digitally signed the message using their own private key, cannot claim that they did not in fact send the e-mail). However, one thing it doesn't seem to<span class="diff-delete"> profide</span><span class="diff-add"> provide</span> is <em>recipient non-repudiation</em>; the recipient can still claim that they didn't receive the sender's e-mail, when in fact it was received, read and understood.</p>

<p> Most measures in place to provide this are voluntary on the part of the recipient; they can choose to send a "read receipt" to the sender indicating they received the message. These are e-mails, and like any, they can be spoofed unless the message is in turn encrypted in the PGP scheme. Or, the recipient can opt not to send the read receipt. In some cases, some e-mail providers and some e-mail programs/plugins even allow a recipient to send a fake "undeliverable" response to the sender (this is a strategy for fighting spam; by making your address <em>look</em> invalid to the spammer, he's encouraged to remove it from his mailing lists).</p>

<p> So, two questions; first, is there any existing scheme that enforces mandatory recipient non-repudiation measures? And second, if there isn't, what might you posit as a workable solution to provide this as an extension to PGP?</p>

<p> Something I thought of would require third-party participation of some kind. Normally, a PGP -encrypted message includes the symmetric key, encrypted with the recipient's public key, both sent directly to the recipient. What if, instead, that encrypted key were sent to a trusted third party "key holder", such as the sender's "home" e-mail server, along with the recipient's public-key certificate? The key holder can be authenticated with its own public-key certificate, thus also allowing secure communication between all parties including the key holder. Then, the message sent to the recipient would include a "pointer" to the key holder and a nonce identifying the message. </p>

<p> In order to actually read the message, the recipient needs to get the key from the key holder, so the recipient crafts a request for the key, signed with their certificate, and sends it to the key holder. The key holder uses the recipient's certificate (which the sender had provided along with the encrypted message key) to verify that it is the intended recipient asking for the key, and complies. The key holder now has proof that the intended recipient received the message they were asking about and is attempting to read it, and can inform the sender of that fact. This is a pretty strong "read receipt", IMO; you can't prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the message actually was read top to bottom,<span class="diff-delete"> left to right</span><span class="diff-add"> line by line</span>, and<span class="diff-add"> its content</span> understood by the end user, but you can at least prove that you led the horse to water.</p>
