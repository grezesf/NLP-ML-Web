It is impossible for one</span><span class="diff-add"> ask "what it means</span> to<span class="diff-delete"> act or have</span><span class="diff-add"> exist", ie Human Beings.

The study undertaken by this route (continued by Sartre and the existentialists) seems primarily related to human existence, and</span> not<span class="diff-delete"> exist</span><span class="diff-add"> existence per se</span>.</p><p><span class="diff-delete"> To be created is</span><span class="diff-add"> I hope that I can take another approach</span> to<span class="diff-delete"> come into existence.

That would</span><span class="diff-add"> "to create" given above, "to</span> be<span class="diff-delete"> illogical as it would</span><span class="diff-add"> created" should</span> be<span class="diff-delete"> defining something</span><span class="diff-add"> defined</span> as<span class="diff-delete"> both</span><span class="diff-add"> "to be brought into existence where previously</span> one<span class="diff-delete"> thing and the direct contradiction of that</span><span class="diff-add"> did not exist".

I'll consider each briefly</span>.</p><p><span class="diff-delete"> Space</span><span class="diff-add"> "Relativity says space</span> and time are<span class="diff-delete"> intimately connected</span><span class="diff-add"> on equal footing - together they are the fabric of reality" (</span><a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21829211.700-space-vs-time-one-has-to-go--but-which.html" rel="nofollow"><em><span class="diff-add">New Scientist</span></em></a><span class="diff-add">)</span>.<span class="diff-delete"> Matter does not exist outside</span><span class="diff-add"> The article this appears in goes on to describe that space and time are part of a single four dimensional fabric that can be modelled mathematically in ways that are very useful for predicting the behaviour</span> of<span class="diff-add"> large objects. On this view, space cannot exist where there is not</span> time,<span class="diff-delete"> and</span><span class="diff-add"> nor can</span> time<span class="diff-delete"> does not</span> exist without<span class="diff-delete"> matter</span><span class="diff-add"> space</span>.<span class="diff-delete"> Since, in the creation of the universe we have an event in which both of these things are being created simultaneously</span><span class="diff-add"> Both include each other. If</span> we<span class="diff-delete"> cannot</span> say<span class="diff-delete"> that</span> the universe<span class="diff-add"> consists of this fabric, I would argue that self-creation</span> is<span class="diff-delete"> created at any other point than</span><span class="diff-add"> not possible. The reason for that is that on this model</span> the<span class="diff-delete"> beginning</span><span class="diff-add"> laws</span> of<span class="diff-delete"> time</span><span class="diff-add"> physics hold</span>.<span class="diff-delete"> Whatever</span><span class="diff-add"> Effect follows cause. The effect of being</span> created<span class="diff-delete"> the universe, did so outside</span><span class="diff-add"> must follow its cause</span> of<span class="diff-delete"> time, prior</span><span class="diff-add"> creation. </span></p><p><span class="diff-add"> Here we come</span> to the<span class="diff-delete"> beginning</span><span class="diff-add"> nub</span> of<span class="diff-delete"> time (though here "prior" must</span><span class="diff-add"> the question. Is it necessary to exist in order to create? Or more broadly is it necessary to exist in order to act or</span> have an<span class="diff-delete"> unusual meaning)</span><span class="diff-add"> effect</span>.<span class="diff-delete"> But we know that</span><span class="diff-add"> I believe</span> the<span class="diff-delete"> universe consists of time and space</span><span class="diff-add"> answer to this is obvious</span>, and<span class="diff-delete"> where</span><span class="diff-add"> so I will proceed without the support of refernces for this point. Let us say, at least for</span> the<span class="diff-add"> sake of argument that to create presupposes to exist. Therefore the thing which creates the</span> universe<span class="diff-delete"> is there is time and space</span><span class="diff-add"> must exist in the instant prior to creation in order to create</span>.<span class="diff-delete"> So</span><span class="diff-add"> While</span> the universe<span class="diff-delete"> cannot both</span><span class="diff-add">, to</span> be<span class="diff-delete"> time and space and create itself before time</span><span class="diff-add"> created</span>,<span class="diff-delete"> as it would</span><span class="diff-add"> must</span> not<span class="diff-delete"> be itself at</span><span class="diff-add"> exist in the instant prior to creation in order</span> that<span class="diff-delete"> time,</span> it<span class="diff-delete"> would</span><span class="diff-add"> may</span> be<span class="diff-delete"> something else</span><span class="diff-add"> created</span>.</p><p><span class="diff-delete"> To answer briefly the question of whether</span><span class="diff-add"> This presents two opposing requirements that cannot be reconciled in</span> the<span class="diff-delete"> universe can create itself: no</span><span class="diff-add"> one thing</span>,<span class="diff-delete"> time forbids it</span><span class="diff-add"> the creator must exist</span> in<span class="diff-delete"> two senses. Firstly, one cannot act</span><span class="diff-add"> the instant prior to creation while the created thing must not exist</span> in the<span class="diff-delete"> past</span><span class="diff-add"> instant prior to creation</span>.<span class="diff-delete"> Secondly,</span><span class="diff-add"> Therefore a creator cannot create itself. Thus</span> the universe cannot<span class="diff-delete"> be and not be at the same time</span><span class="diff-add"> create itself</span>.<span class="diff-delete"> &nbsp;</span><span class="diff-add">&nbsp;  </span></p><p><span class="diff-delete"> The subsequent question of what created the universe, can be pointed to on</span><span class="diff-add"> Yet</span> the<span class="diff-delete"> basis of</span><span class="diff-add"> idea that</span> the<span class="diff-delete"> answer so far: Something outside</span><span class="diff-add"> universe consists</span> of<span class="diff-add"> a single four dimensional</span> space<span class="diff-delete"> and time. Judging by</span><span class="diff-add">-time fabric is contested on</span> the<span class="diff-add"> minute</span> scale<span class="diff-delete"> and intricacy</span> of<span class="diff-delete"> the observable universe it was something very powerful and precise</span><span class="diff-add"> quantum mechanics</span>.<span class="diff-delete"> Looking at humanity and our reason, our achievements in art</span><span class="diff-add"> Space</span> and<span class="diff-delete"> science</span><span class="diff-add"> time</span>,<span class="diff-delete"> our capacity for emotion and so on</span><span class="diff-add"> may</span>,<span class="diff-delete"> it was something</span><span class="diff-add"> when considered at</span> that<span class="diff-delete"> gave birth to unlimited potential</span><span class="diff-add"> level, be separate, or they may both be expresions of a more primal reality (</span><em><span class="diff-add">New Scientist</span></em> <span class="diff-add">as above)</span>.<span class="diff-delete"> Given</span><span class="diff-add"> If</span> the<span class="diff-delete"> unlikeliness of human potential flourishing I would</span><span class="diff-add"> universe is defined to include this primal reality there may be scope for saying it created itself.

                <p><span class="diff-add"> This is</span> a<span class="diff-add"> major rewrite of my previous answer, so if you've read it before you might like to read it again. I'll begin with a definition: "to create" - Bring (something) into existence. (dictionary.reference.com/browse/create). </span></p><p><span class="diff-add"> The question of what it means to</span> exist is one<span class="diff-add"> that has been covered</span> at<span class="diff-add"> depth by</span> the<span class="diff-add"> existentialists</span>.<span class="diff-add"> A pre-cursor to</span> the<span class="diff-add"> existentialists, Martin Heidegger investigated</span> that<span class="diff-add"> bit</span> of<span class="diff-add"> reality which has the power</span> to<span class="diff-add"> ask "what it means</span> to<span class="diff-add"> exist", ie Human Beings. (Heidegger proposes this philosophical investigation in </span><em><span class="diff-add">Being and Time</span></em><span class="diff-add">,</span> an<span class="diff-add"> outline of which can be found </span><a href="http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/Cavalier/80254/Heidegger/introductions/Overview.html" rel="nofollow"><span class="diff-add">here</span></a><span class="diff-add">.) The study undertaken by this route (continued by Sartre and the existentialists) seems primarily related to human existence, and</span> not<span class="diff-add"> existence per se</span>.</p><p><span class="diff-add"> I hope that I can take another approach</span> to<span class="diff-add"> begin</span> to<span class="diff-add"> answer this question</span>.<span class="diff-add"> I</span> would<span class="diff-add"> like</span> to<span class="diff-add"> propose</span> that,<span class="diff-add"> based on</span> the<span class="diff-add"> definition</span> of<span class="diff-add"> "to create" given above, "to</span> be<span class="diff-add"> created" should</span> be<span class="diff-add"> defined</span> as<span class="diff-add"> "to be brought into existence where previously</span> one<span class="diff-add"> did not exist". If in fact to create is to bring into existence, before one is created one has not been brought into existence. Therefore an uncreated</span> thing<span class="diff-add"> has either: always existed, or does not exist</span>.</p><p><span class="diff-add"> With some agreement on what it means</span> to<span class="diff-add"> create and be created we can look at</span> the<span class="diff-add"> thing in question</span>,<span class="diff-add"> the universe. What</span> exactly is<span class="diff-add"> the</span> universe<span class="diff-add">? There are many competing definitions available</span>.<span class="diff-add"> For</span> the<span class="diff-add"> purpose of this discussion I would like to appeal to scientific defintions. </span></p><p><span class="diff-add"> Accepted scientific definitions of the universe have been</span> and<span class="diff-add"> continue to be contested</span>.<span class="diff-add"> At</span> this<span class="diff-add"> point in time we can consider definitions from two camps within physics:</span> the<span class="diff-add"> theory offered by Einstein's theory of general relativity and the theories offered by quantum mechanics. I'll consider each briefly</span>.</p><p><span class="diff-add"> "Relativity says space</span> and time are<span class="diff-add"> on equal footing - together they are the fabric of reality" (</span><a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21829211.700-space-vs-time-one-has-to-go--but-which.html" rel="nofollow"><em><span class="diff-add">New Scientist</span></em></a><span class="diff-add">)</span>.<span class="diff-add"> The article this appears in goes on to describe that space and time are part of a single four dimensional fabric that can be modelled mathematically in ways that are very useful for predicting the behaviour</span> of<span class="diff-add"> large objects. On this view, space cannot exist where there is not</span> time,<span class="diff-add"> nor can</span> time exist without<span class="diff-add"> space</span>.<span class="diff-add"> Both include each other. If</span> we say the universe<span class="diff-add"> consists of this fabric, I would argue that self-creation</span> is<span class="diff-add"> not possible. The reason for that is that on this model</span> the<span class="diff-add"> laws</span> of<span class="diff-add"> physics hold</span>.<span class="diff-add"> Effect follows cause. The effect of being</span> created<span class="diff-add"> must follow its cause</span> of<span class="diff-add"> creation. </span></p><p><span class="diff-add"> Here we come</span> to the<span class="diff-add"> nub</span> of<span class="diff-add"> the question. Is it necessary to exist in order to create? Or more broadly is it necessary to exist in order to act or</span> have an<span class="diff-add"> effect</span>.<span class="diff-add"> I believe</span> the<span class="diff-add"> answer to this is obvious</span>, and<span class="diff-add"> so I will proceed without the support of refernces for this point. Let us say, at least for</span> the<span class="diff-add"> sake of argument that to create presupposes to exist. Therefore the thing which creates the</span> universe<span class="diff-add"> must exist in the instant prior to creation in order to create</span>.<span class="diff-add"> While</span> the universe<span class="diff-add">, to</span> be<span class="diff-add"> created</span>,<span class="diff-add"> must</span> not<span class="diff-add"> exist in the instant prior to creation in order</span> that it<span class="diff-add"> may</span> be<span class="diff-add"> created</span>.<span class="diff-add"> This presents two opposing requirements that cannot be reconciled in</span> the<span class="diff-add"> one thing</span>,<span class="diff-add"> the creator must exist</span> in<span class="diff-add"> the instant prior to creation while the created thing must not exist</span> in the<span class="diff-add"> instant prior to creation</span>.<span class="diff-add"> Therefore a creator cannot create itself.

        <div class="post-text">
            <p>Is the idea that a universe can create itself nonsense?</p>

<p>To act or otherwise have an effect, one must in some sense exist. Creation is an action, therefore in order to create one must first exist, and be in existence, at the time of creation. At least the creator must be in existence at the time that the chain of events leading to creation was initiated. It is impossible for one to act or have an effect if one does not exist.</p>

<p>To be created is to come into existence. To transition from not-being to being. Yet it would be incorrect to say that one can be in a state of not-being, as if one existed and simply had the quality of not-existing. That would be illogical as it would be defining something as both one thing and the direct contradiction of that thing.</p>

<p>The question pertains to the universe, but what exactly is that? The universe is space and time. Space being filled with physical matter and the forces and laws that govern that matter. One might also call this the physical or natural universe.</p>

<p>Space and time are intimately connected. Matter does not exist outside of time, and time does not exist without matter. Since, in the creation of the universe we have an event in which both of these things are being created simultaneously we cannot say that the universe is created at any other point than the beginning of time. Whatever created the universe, did so outside of time, prior to the beginning of time (though here "prior" must have an unusual meaning). But we know that the universe consists of time and space, and where the universe is there is time and space. So the universe cannot both be time and space and create itself before time, as it would not be itself at that time, it would be something else.</p>

<p>To answer briefly the question of whether the universe can create itself: no, time forbids it in two senses. Firstly, one cannot act in the past. Secondly, the universe cannot be and not be at the same time. </p>

<p>The subsequent question of what created the universe, can be pointed to on the basis of the answer so far: Something outside of space and time. Judging by the scale and intricacy of the observable universe it was something very powerful and precise. Looking at humanity and our reason, our achievements in art and science, our capacity for emotion and so on, it was something that gave birth to unlimited potential. Given the unlikeliness of human potential flourishing I would say that whatever created the universe that we live in did so purposefully to enable human flourishing.</p>

<p>But the question is whether it is nonsense to say the universe created itself. Well, strictly, yes, for the reasons summarized here: to create one must exist, to be created one begins to exist when one did not previously exist, a thing cannot be and not be simultaneously.</p>
