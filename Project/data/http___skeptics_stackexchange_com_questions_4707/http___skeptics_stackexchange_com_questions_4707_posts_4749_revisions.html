            <p>I'll just go ahead and start with: <strong>no</strong>. Unfortunately, this can't really be backed up scientifically... but that's because it's not being put forth scientifically. It could theoretically be backed up statistically, by showing the proportion of Macbeth performances with issues compared to those without, and then by comparing that to the amount of other plays with issues to those without globally, but... that's... well, just too much data. And as far as I can tell (<a href="http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4222" rel="nofollow">and as far as Skeptoid can tell</a>), it doesn't exist. It would be a huge time investment to disprove something that there's no scientific evidence of in the first place.</p>

<p>The problem is that you're asking about... well, a curse. There's a big presumption here, and it's that curses exist. To prove something does or doesn't exist, one must be able to point at an observable phenomenon and attribute it to a natural mechanism. We have neither an observable phenomenon here nor a mechanism with which to understand it. It's the same problem with questions on God or other deities: we can have faith and believe, but there is no scientific, empirical study or experiment that can be done to prove <strong>or</strong> disprove their existence. Something like this is a proof by tautology: it is because it is.</p>

<p>Related is the assumption that witches of the time--in whatever form they did or didn't exist--could actually cast such a curse. Again, we have no way of proving this (or knowing that there were witches present, or that Shakespeare got his info from witches, or whatever story you'd like to believe. Very few of these earlier tales can be cited, as Skeptoid explains above). There's a <a href="http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3331/does-black-magic-work">good question here on Skeptics about black magic</a> that concludes it's not real, but again for this kind of claim, it's nearly impossible to "really" disprove it since you're disproving not-phenomona with more not-phenomena.</p>

<p>If this is really a curse, though, let's call it what it is: a curse of bad luck (both of which are pretty synonymous anyway). But <strong>luck is just a human construct that we create to try to find a patterns and order between otherwise unrelated events</strong>. And in the end, that's what all of these are: unrelated events.</p>

<p>When a rumor goes on this long, as Lagerbaer said in the comments, you've got a pretty powerful sell-fulfilling prophecy. People are going to look in one place for problems, ignore them elsewhere, and cry loudly when they arise. What really needs to be asked is, "Are these events, true or false, atypical?" We're talking about one of the most popular plays/stories in the world, one that's been performed for over 400 years now. How many thousands, hundreds of thousands of performances is that? Google "Macbeth performances" and you get almost nine million hits. Of course they're not all unique or useful, but this is an exercise in massive scale. Let's say Macbeth is only performed once per year. Your source document has 27 instances noted, but even 27 terrible incidents out of 400 is just 6.75%. Is the margin for accidents in stage performances so drastically less than 6.75% worldwide that this deserves to be considered bad luck?</p>

<p>Furthermore, in looking for a curse, you find yourself attaching mishaps to an event that would otherwise have no relevant place in that event's context (and are certainly in no way provably causal). England was hit with an extremely violent storm on the day production opened. So? What other billions of actions were taken that day, and why didn't they cause the storm? Lincoln was reading Macbeth a week before he was killed... and? That's not even talking about stage productions, that's implying any one of us could be stricken down for a 9th grade reading assignment.</p>

<p>We're looking for a pattern that's not there, that's all.</p>

<p>In more fun news, in searching for the curse of Macbeth, I first accidentally looked for the "curse of hamlet," and came upon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_Ham" rel="nofollow">this little gem</a>, which seems appropriate here in name (given the asker's name), though certainly not in meaning (though if one does choose to believe in curses, it certainly helps in setting a very old precedent of sorts).</p>
