<p><strong>RECOMMENDATION #1 : <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_super" rel="nofollow">Check SUPER Privilege for all DB Users</a></strong></p>

<p> Make sure all users do not have SUPER privilege. Once you hit max_connections, mysqld will only allow one more connection to itself, and that user must have SUPER privilege. If all users have SUPER privilege, no DBA or sysadmin can ever login to MySQL and do admin tasks. Please do an inventory of all users and make sure that only necessary users have SUPER privilege.</p>

<p><strong>RECOMMENDATION #2 : Check MySQL Connections from the OS Point-of-View</strong></p>

<p> If you cannot connect to mysqld, try<span class="diff-delete"> run</span><span class="diff-add"> running</span> this in Linux on the DB Server</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> When you're running a MySQL server on Windows with many TCP/IP
  connections to it, and you're experiencing that quite often your
  clients get a Can't connect to MySQL server error, the reason might be
  that Windows does not allow for enough ephemeral (short-lived) ports
  to serve those connections. </p>
  
  <p> The purpose of TIME_WAIT is to keep a connection accepting packets
  even after the connection has been closed. This is because Internet
  routing can cause a packet to take a slow route to its destination and
  it may arrive after both sides have agreed to close. If the port is in
  use for a new connection, that packet from the old connection could
  break the protocol or compromise personal information from the
  original connection. The TIME_WAIT delay prevents this by ensuring
  that the port cannot be reused until after some time has been
  permitted for those delayed packets to arrive. </p>
  
  <p> It is safe to reduce TIME_WAIT greatly on LAN connections because
  there is little chance of packets arriving at very long delays, as
  they could through the Internet with its comparatively large distances
  and latencies. </p>
  
  <p> Windows permits ephemeral (short-lived) TCP ports to the user. After
  any port is closed it will remain in a TIME_WAIT status for 120
  seconds. The port will not be available again until this time expires.
  The default range of port numbers depends on the version of Windows,
  with a more limited number of ports in older versions: </p>
  
  <p> • Windows through Server 2003: Ports in range 1025–5000</p>
  
  <p> • Windows Vista, Server 2008, and newer: Ports in range 49152–65535 </p>
  
  <p> With a small stack of available TCP ports (5000) and a high number of
  TCP ports being open and closed over a short period of time along with
  the TIME_WAIT status you have a good chance for running out of ports.
  There are two ways to address this problem: </p>
  
  <p> • Reduce the number of TCP ports consumed quickly by investigating
  connection pooling or persistent connections where possible</p>
  
  <p> • Tune some settings in the Windows registry (see below)</p>

</span><blockquote><span class="diff-add">
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> When you're running a MySQL server on Windows with many TCP/IP
  connections to it, and you're experiencing that quite often your
  clients get a Can't connect to MySQL server error, the reason might be
  that Windows does not allow for enough ephemeral (short-lived) ports
  to serve those connections. </span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> The purpose of TIME_WAIT is to keep a connection accepting packets
  even after the connection has been closed. This is because Internet
  routing can cause a packet to take a slow route to its destination and
  it may arrive after both sides have agreed to close. If the port is in
  use for a new connection, that packet from the old connection could
  break the protocol or compromise personal information from the
  original connection. The TIME_WAIT delay prevents this by ensuring
  that the port cannot be reused until after some time has been
  permitted for those delayed packets to arrive. </span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> It is safe to reduce TIME_WAIT greatly on LAN connections because
  there is little chance of packets arriving at very long delays, as
  they could through the Internet with its comparatively large distances
  and latencies. </span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> Windows permits ephemeral (short-lived) TCP ports to the user. After
  any port is closed it will remain in a TIME_WAIT status for 120
  seconds. The port will not be available again until this time expires.
  The default range of port numbers depends on the version of Windows,
  with a more limited number of ports in older versions: </span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> • Windows through Server 2003: Ports in range 1025–5000</span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> • Windows Vista, Server 2008, and newer: Ports in range 49152–65535 </span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> With a small stack of available TCP ports (5000) and a high number of
  TCP ports being open and closed over a short period of time along with
  the TIME_WAIT status you have a good chance for running out of ports.
