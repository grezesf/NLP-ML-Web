            <p> It is not possible to do exhaustive testing in the context of data warehousing. I had been into ETL testing. There was a corner case bug in which if there is a lock created on one of the tables in the source database, the migration of data to the destination DB failed. <strong>Is it possible for any tester to imagine a scenario where table gets locked automatically during a transaction?</strong> </p>

<p> We created a lock using SQL to reproduce the issue in test environment. However, on debugging LIVE logs in real-time, we found that the lock was created due to a long running SQL query which tried to fetch a record from millions of rows of data. The bug caused missing transactions and around $400K loss of money to client. We fixed the issue and brainstormed ways to improve test coverage.</p>

<p> ETL testing is a critical area and since it is DB-related there are many variables other than permutation-combination that impact it. I would recommend you to do exhaustive testing for the basic functionalities of the system without worrying about 100% test coverage. The above issue is a DB design issue which is out of tester's control. If the DB is partitioned properly the SQL query can fetch data quickly even if there are 1000 users using it. We moved the records that could not be migrated successfully to an exception queue as a temporary solution.</p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><span class="diff-add"> The issue you had cited looks more like a product design/architecture issue which should have been caught in the code review/peer review by the DEV. The product should allow users from UK, Australia and New Zealand to concurrently use the system. When they enter the same data there should not be any clash/conflict.</span></p>

                <p> It is not possible to do exhaustive testing in the context of data warehousing. I had been into ETL testing. There was a corner case bug in which if there is a lock created on one of the tables in the source database, the migration of data to the destination DB failed. <strong>Is it possible for any tester to imagine a scenario where table gets locked automatically during a transaction?</strong> </p>

<p> We created a lock using SQL to reproduce the issue in test environment. However, on debugging LIVE logs in real-time, we found that the lock was created due to a long running SQL query which tried to fetch a record from millions of rows of data. The bug caused missing transactions and around $400K loss of money to client. We fixed the issue and brainstormed ways to improve test coverage.</p>

<p> ETL testing is a critical area and since it is DB-related there are many variables other than permutation-combination that impact it. I would recommend you to do exhaustive testing for the basic functionalities of the system without worrying about 100% test coverage. The above issue is a DB design issue which is out of tester's control. If the DB is partitioned properly the SQL query can fetch data quickly even if there are 1000 users using it.<span class="diff-add"> We moved the records that could not be migrated successfully to an exception queue as a temporary solution.</span></p>
