            <p> Let's compare two rockets with somewhat similar specifications, but one very large difference.</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Falcon 1- Carries about 670 KG to LEO (See the <a href="http://www.spacex.com/Falcon1UsersGuide.pdf" rel="nofollow">User's Guide</a>) Mass 38555 KG (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_1" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>). Launched from sea level.</p></li>
<li><p> Pegasus- Carries about 450 KG to LEO (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_%28rocket%29" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>). Mass 18,500 KG. Launched from 40,000 feet.</p></li>
</ul>

<p> This makes a lot of assumptions, but let's just assume you could scale linearly the mass of the Pegasus. That would give the rocket a mass of 27000 KG to lift the payload of the Falcon 1. That is a difference of 40% roughly. Why the difference?</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Falcon 1 is a LOX/RP liquid propellant rocket whereas Pegasus is solid rocket based. The technologies have vastly different thrust/weight ratios, specific impulse, and mass fractions. Solid rockets tend to have higher mass fractions and T/W because the engines are less complex (i.e. no pressurization systems, or plumbing, or turbo-pump machinery. But solids are typically more expensive, and typically have fixed impulse burns (i.e. they cannot be turned off). This is less of an issue for early stages, but the reason the Pegasus added the optional HAPS (hydrazine) final stage for precision orbit insertion.</p></li>
<li><p> Because it is air-launched Pegasus can fly a different trajectory. Instead of a low angle-of-attack ascent followed by a gravity turn, Pegasus has wings. It flies at positive angle of attack and uses lift to aid in ascent.</p></li>
<li><p> Engines at altitude can use a more efficient engine design (i.e. rocket nozzle expansion ratios tuned to atmospheric pressure at drop vice sea level.</p></li>
<li><p> There is a small velocity gain from the air launch. This isn't significant<span class="diff-add"> (~2% of orbital velocity)</span>, but is there.</p></li>
<li><p> The Pegasus doesn't have to worry about changing inclinations, as the Falcon<span class="diff-delete"> 9</span><span class="diff-add"> 1</span> does. But the specified numbers for Falcon 1 don't take in to account a varied inclination.</p></li>
<li><p> There is considerably less air density at 40,000 feet, which results in lower integrated drag losses<span class="diff-delete">. This is probably a non-negligible but very small difference</span>.<span class="diff-delete"> &nbsp;</span></p></li>
<li><p> You are 10 km higher at altitude. This probably isn't significant.</p></li>
</ol>

<p> Bottom line is, raising your altitude of your launch site will give you an increase in performance, both by increasing your engine efficiency, and reducing your drag. These numbers wouldn't be as drastic for a launch site of 10,000 feet, but they still would represent a measurable change in performance.</p>

            <p> Let's compare two rockets with somewhat similar specifications, but one very large difference.</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Falcon 1- Carries about 670 KG to LEO (See the <a href="http://www.spacex.com/Falcon1UsersGuide.pdf" rel="nofollow">User's Guide</a>) Mass 38555 KG (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_1" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>). Launched from sea level.</p></li>
<li><p> Pegasus- Carries about 450 KG to LEO (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_%28rocket%29" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>). Mass 18,500 KG. Launched from 40,000 feet.</p></li>
</ul>

<p> This makes a lot of assumptions, but let's just assume you could scale linearly the mass of the Pegasus. That would give the rocket a mass of 27000 KG to lift the payload of the Falcon 1. That is a difference of 40% roughly. Why the difference?</p>

<ol>
<li><span class="diff-delete"> There is a small velocity gain from the air launch. This isn't significant, but is there.</span><p><span class="diff-add"> Falcon 1 is a LOX/RP liquid propellant rocket whereas Pegasus is solid rocket based. The technologies have vastly different thrust/weight ratios, specific impulse, and mass fractions. Solid rockets tend to have higher mass fractions and T/W because the engines are less complex (i.e. no pressurization systems, or plumbing, or turbo-pump machinery. But solids are typically more expensive, and typically have fixed impulse burns (i.e. they cannot be turned off). This is less of an issue for early stages, but the reason the Pegasus added the optional HAPS (hydrazine) final stage for precision orbit insertion.</span></p></li>
<li><span class="diff-delete"> The Pegasus doesn't have to worry about changing inclinations, as the Falcon 9 does. But the specified numbers for Falcon 1 don't take in to account a varied inclination.</span><p><span class="diff-add"> Because it is air-launched Pegasus can fly a different trajectory. Instead of a low angle-of-attack ascent followed by a gravity turn, Pegasus has wings. It flies at positive angle of attack and uses lift to aid in ascent.</span></p></li>
<li><span class="diff-delete"> There is considerably less drag at 40,000 feet.</span><p><span class="diff-add"> Engines at altitude can use a more efficient engine design (i.e. rocket nozzle expansion ratios tuned to atmospheric pressure at drop vice sea level.</span></p></li>
<li><span class="diff-delete"> You are 10 km higher at altitude. This probably isn't significant.</span><p><span class="diff-add"> There is a small velocity gain from the air launch. This isn't significant, but is there.</span></p></li>
<li><span class="diff-delete"> Engines at altitude can use a more efficient engine design.</span><p><span class="diff-add"> The Pegasus doesn't have to worry about changing inclinations, as the Falcon 9 does.

</span><li><p><span class="diff-add"> There is considerably less air density at 40,000 feet, which results in lower integrated drag losses. This is probably a non-negligible but very small difference. </span></p></li><span class="diff-add">
</span><li><p><span class="diff-add"> You are 10 km higher at altitude. This probably isn't significant.</span></p></li>
</ol>

<p> Bottom line is, raising your altitude of your launch site will give you an increase in performance, both by increasing your engine efficiency, and reducing your drag. These numbers wouldn't be as drastic for a launch site of 10,000 feet, but they still would represent a measurable change in performance.</p>
