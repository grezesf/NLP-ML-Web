        <h1></h1>

        <div class="post-text">
            <p>It seems to me you understand the general problem (you and your wife can't reconcile two different discipline styles), and that it may cause a problem for your children (but you don't know what form that may take), and the solution (stop giving mixed messages); but you're saying because of your wife's unreasonableness, you're giving up on the solution, and want to move on to mitigating the bad effects of the problem on your children.</p>

<p>While I think that it's very forward-looking of you to try to do this, I agree with Dan Beale:  you and your wife can find a solution, you just need a little help to figure out how.  You feel that since you're willing to admit you are too relaxed about making your kids follow the rules you have set, she should respond by admitting it's sometimes okay to let some things slide a bit.  She will not, and this rigidity is preventing you from making the changes you know you need to make.  You want her to compromise, too.</p>

<p>Except, the way things are now, she probably can't.  Here's why I think that (and I admit I am making a fair number of assumptions here).</p>

<p>You say she is the main breadwinner, and her responsibilities have increased in the last months.  I am guessing she comes home at the end of a stressful day at work longing to spend some quality time with her kids.  I am also guessing she has what she perceives a very short time in which to interact with them before they must go to bed.  If she then finds out that you have slacked off the discipline during the day, and things aren't done that must be done (e.g., homework), or things were done that have yet to be cleaned up, and she must be the "heavy" for this little bit of time she has with them, and if it happens <em>every single night</em>, she would have to be spitting mad.</p>

<p>At this point it is not a difference in parenting styles to her; it is her missing out on her share of the <em>joy</em> of being a mother because of your perceived laziness.  By the time she has fixed everything (from her point of view) and got them into bed, she probably is in no mood to concede that you might be right about anything, even that the sun will come up tomorrow.  (And advising someone to calm down is the best known way to make them even wilder, by the way.)</p>

<p>My suggestion:  start by giving her the gift of quality time with the kids.  The next time she comes home, the house should be clean, the homework done, the supper ready, whatever.  Bring out some family game you can play, and all of you have fun.  After the kids are in bed you can talk.</p>

<p>To begin with, any rule you are not enforcing is not a rule, but a suggestion.  (You may decide that making the beds could fall into this category.  Teaching a child to choose to have a clean room can be an art and a joy on its own.)</p>

<p>For things you do decide should be rules, natural consequences -- having the kids take the responsibility of their acts -- is a good start.  For some things it is even enough.  However, the natural consequence of "not brushing your teeth at night" should not be "you'll get cavities," because a young child may not care about cavities, but it is still your responsiblity as a parent to take care of their teeth.  The better "natural consequence" would be, "We don't have time to read a second book because I have to help you brush them."</p>

<p>For other rules, it would be a greater stretch to have a "natural" consequence that would work effectively.   While "Next time I'd better do my homework!" is the lesson some children would learn from getting a bad grade, for others the lesson would be, "I got a bad grade but the world didn't end; failure is okay, too."  And that's a lesson you only want them to learn after they've learned how sweet -- and achievable -- success can be, by dint of hard work and persistence.</p>

<p>So please don't jump yet to how to mitigate the effects of the mixed messages. The answer would certainly include telling them their parents are doing the best they can but they're not perfect, or finding a third person to be the steady rock they need; but why cede your parental authority any sooner than you have to?  Even if you have to go to counseling, the problem of how to get your wife to listen to you without feeling attacked (so that the two of you can come up with a single parenting strategy) might be a perfect opportunity to demonstrate your own hard work and persistence.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
