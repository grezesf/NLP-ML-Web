            <p> Amazing you can run a lot on just fruits and veg!</p>

<p> Regarding that particularly sort of <strong>odd tingly problem</strong> you describe.  I've got a feeling it might be a problem relating to <em>hypoglycemia</em> - a difficult and sometimes misunderstood condition.</p>

<p> It can lead to issues like migraines if (in short) you have problems with the dynamics of your bloody sugar levels.</p>

<p> I encourage you to buy this book: <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0658001701" rel="nofollow">by Dr Wolfgang Lutz</a> and turn to page 42 for details. Notice the graphs on page 43 - that seemingly tiny difference is a huge difference in your body operations.  Since I guess you've lived on just sugar for a few years (most fruit and veg is just sugar), your body chemistry, anything could be happening.</p>

<p> If you turn back to the comparative graph on page 39 you will see exactly why fat people get fat, if their insulin response is stuffed-up.</p>

<p> Anyway the section on hypoglycemia (and indeed the whole book) may answer the questions you have. Alternately if you speak german consider that "point-diet" book that is popular in austria, etc. at the moment.</p>

<p> In short you will (IMO) have to carefully manage your protein and fat balance (and also any carbs you eat) perhaps for some time (a year?) until your body chemistry - basically the "decay time" of that insulin function - returns to some sort of normality.  I bet that the problem you describe is some variety of hypoglycemia-like problem caused by your bloody sugar levels going crazy in one direction or the other.</p>

<p> As Berin explains, you should really carefully choose "slow" carbohydrates (G.I.) if you must eat carbohydrates.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HQKvl.jpg" alt="sugar curves"></p>

<p><span class="diff-delete"> The black</span><span class="diff-add"> As the caption says the dotted</span> curve shows what hypoglycemia looks like (it can cause migraines and similar problems not unlike AnAnt describes), and the<span class="diff-delete"> dotted lines</span><span class="diff-add"> solid line</span> shows a healthy person.

            <p> Amazing you can run a lot on just fruits and veg!</p>

<p> Regarding that particularly sort of <strong>odd tingly problem</strong> you describe.  I've got a feeling it might be a problem relating to <em>hypoglycemia</em> - a difficult and sometimes misunderstood condition.</p>

<p> It can lead to issues like migraines if (in short) you have problems with the dynamics of your bloody sugar levels.</p>

<p> I encourage you to buy this book: <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0658001701" rel="nofollow">by Dr Wolfgang Lutz</a> and turn to page 42 for details. Notice the graphs on page 43 - that seemingly tiny difference is a huge difference in your body operations.  Since I guess you've lived on just sugar for a few years (most fruit and veg is just sugar), your body chemistry, anything could be happening.</p>

<p> If you turn back to the comparative graph on page 39 you will see exactly why fat people get fat, if their insulin response is stuffed-up.</p>

<p> Anyway the section on hypoglycemia (and indeed the whole book) may answer the questions you have. Alternately if you speak german consider that "point-diet" book that is popular in austria, etc. at the moment.</p>

<p> In short you will (IMO) have to carefully manage your protein and fat balance (and also any carbs you eat) perhaps for some time (a year?) until your body chemistry - basically the "decay time" of that insulin function - returns to some sort of normality.  I bet that the problem you describe is some variety of hypoglycemia-like problem caused by your bloody sugar levels going crazy in one direction or the other.</p>

<p> As Berin explains, you should really carefully choose "slow" carbohydrates (G.I.) if you must eat carbohydrates.</p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><img class="diff-add"src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/HQKvl.jpg" alt="sugar curves"></p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><span class="diff-add"> The black curve shows what hypoglycemia looks like (it can cause migraines and similar problems not unlike AnAnt describes), and the dotted lines shows a healthy person.  Conceivably eating just right for a year or so could bring you to the "dotted" situation.</span></p>
