            <p> I've had a chili bush I grew from seed for about a year now, and it's finally growing into something resembling an actual bush (rather than just a seedling) and it was going great until the last few weeks.</p>

<p> The new leaves are starting to kind of crinkle, and the most recent new shoots look as though they're dying entirely.</p>

<p> In spite of this it's bravely trying to grow a pepper on it!</p>

<p> But yeah - couldn't see any pests (other than the stupid things that ate the leaves further down the plant a month or so ago which are no longer affecting it) so am I looking at bacteria, fungus, virus, or deficiency here? Or something else?!</p>

<p> Location: Brisbane, Australia. It's late Summer here. Soil is clay, although clay breaker has been used occasionally on it, and the grass nearby has been fertilised recently.</p>

<p> Here's some pics in case it helps:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/QcPKP.jpg" alt="Malformed and dying new shoots">
<img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/nDOen.jpg" alt="Whole chili bush in case it helps"></p>

<p> EDIT: Accepting diagnosis answers is tougher than I envisaged!</p>

<p> So, since originally posting this, I refertilized (herb/veggie fertilizer) which seemed to only very slightly help. Then, we had a cyclone, which dumped 150+mm of rain onto the soil, which also helped a bit, then I cleared the grass in a 50cm diameter circle away from the base, added weed control sheeting, topped with a little new soil, and fertilized with some stuff that had higher calcium concentrations in it than most fertilizer. Result is:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Eq14R.jpg" alt="New shoots after calcium, water, and grass removal"></p>

<p> Doesn't look completely better, but seems a lot less unhappy. So it's really hard to tell which of the three things it was that made the most difference, and I won't really know unless the plant starts to get worse again. As it is, it seems like the new shoots are much less curled (but not completely flat) so... yeah. Here's a pic of the whole bush showing the base etc:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/YR5G4.jpg" alt="Whole bush with base cleared"></p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><span class="diff-add"> EDIT: Latest pics after drenching in eco oil and pyrethrum a week or so ago.</span></p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><span class="diff-add"> As of last week, this is what the worst affected parts of the plant were starting to look like:</span></p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><img class="diff-add"src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/0bzDH.jpg" alt="Worst affected parts example"></p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><span class="diff-add"> I finally tried absolutely drenching the plant in eco oil and pyrethrum (both sides of all the leaves, all trunk/stem surfaces... to the point it was dripping liberally off onto the ground underneath it.) A week or so later, it started to look like it was throwing out new leaves and these weren't affected, so I trimmed off the older damaged foliage etc, and this is now the result:</span></p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><img class="diff-add"src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/c1ipt.jpg" alt="Treated and trimmed plant, much happier"></p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><span class="diff-add"> It... certainly is very suggestive that it might have been a pest that was not easily seen... will wait to make sure it's still on the right track, but all things going well I'd say this will finally get a resolution in a few weeks or so... capsid guy is looking good so far :)</span></p>

<p> EDIT: Accepting diagnosis answers is tougher than I envisaged!</p>

<p> So, since originally posting this, I refertilized (herb/veggie fertilizer) which seemed to only very slightly help. Then, we had a cyclone, which dumped 150+mm of rain onto the soil, which also helped a bit, then I cleared the grass in a 50cm diameter circle away from the base, added weed control sheeting, topped with a little new soil, and fertilized with some stuff that had higher calcium concentrations in it than most fertilizer. Result is:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Eq14R.jpg" alt="New shoots after calcium, water, and grass removal"></p>

<p> Doesn't look completely better, but seems a lot less unhappy. So it's really hard to tell which of the three things it was that made the most difference, and I won't really know unless the plant starts to get worse again. As it is, it seems like the new shoots are much less curled (but not completely flat) so... yeah. Here's a pic of the whole bush showing the base etc:</p>

</span><p><span class="diff-add"> As of last week, this is what the worst affected parts of the plant were starting to look like:</span></p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><span class="diff-add"> I finally tried absolutely drenching the plant in eco oil and pyrethrum (both sides of all the leaves, all trunk/stem surfaces... to the point it was dripping liberally off onto the ground underneath it.) A week or so later, it started to look like it was throwing out new leaves and these weren't affected, so I trimmed off the older damaged foliage etc, and this is now the result:</span></p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><span class="diff-add"> It... certainly is very suggestive that it might have been a pest that was not easily seen... will wait to make sure it's still on the right track, but all things going well I'd say this will finally get a resolution in a few weeks or so... capsid guy is looking good so far :)</span></p>
