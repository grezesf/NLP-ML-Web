            <p>As an aside, before I dive in: I helped port one of these games to a different platform.  Looking at their AI code for finding potentials: yipe, it's complicated and brutish, and not at all cache-friendly.  (Not that it really has to be, since a small board will fit in cache on most systems.)</p>

<p>Let's start with some "fun" bit logic.  (Hopefully this won't net me downvotes.  Bear with me.  You may not have bit operations easily available in your language of choice, but the idea of running the search in parallel if at all possible still applies.)</p>

<p>Assume you have a bitmask representing all of the pieces in a row that are of one particular type.  We'll start with red, and worry about the cost of calculating the bitmask from a 2D array of pieces types later.</p>

<pre><code>// let's assume top right indexing for ease of description
// (the assumption is not necessary, though --
//    it just makes the left-shift and right-shift operators 
//    look like they're pointing in the correct direction)

// this is for row 2
col index  76543210
color      BRRGYRBR
"red" bits 01100101
</code></pre>

<p>(So this might be blue, red, red, green, yellow, red, blue, red, for example.)</p>

<p>You can fairly easily find the places where there is a pattern that just needs one "fixup" to work.  Courtesy Kaj, this is one of three combinations, basically: <code>XoX</code>, <code>oXX</code>, or <code>XXo</code> where <code>X</code> is a matching stone and <code>o</code> is something else.</p>

<p>Let's find all the places where a potential series of 3 exists.  (This idea is borrowed from the marvelous <a href="http://www.hackersdelight.org/" rel="nofollow">Hacker's Delight book</a>; see also the <a href="http://www.jjj.de/fxt/#fxtbook" rel="nofollow">fxtbook</a> if such things delight you.)</p>

<pre><code>// using c-style bitwise operators:
// &amp; is "and"
// ^ is "xor"
// | is "or"
// &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; are arithmetic (non-sign-extending) shifts

redBitsThisRow = redBitsRows[2]

// find the start of an XoX sequence
startOfXoXSequence = redBitsThisRow &amp; (redBitsThisRow &lt;&lt; 2);
// for our example, this will be 00000100

// find any two stones together in a row
startOfXXSequence = redBitsThisRow &amp; (redBitsThisRow &lt;&lt; 1);
// for our example, this will be 01000000
</code></pre>

<p>It's more useful if we know where the <em>missing</em> stone we need to fill in is:</p>

<pre><code>// give us any sequences that might want a stone from the left
missingLeftStone = startOfXXSequence &lt;&lt; 1;
// for our example, this will be 10000000

// give us any sequences that might want a stone from the right
missingRightStone = startOfXXSequence &gt;&gt; 2;
// for our example, this will be 00010000

// give us any sequences that might want a stone from the top or bottom
missingTopOrBottomStone = missingRightStone | missingLeftStone | (startOfXoXSequence &gt;&gt; 1)
// for our example, this will be 10010010
</code></pre>

<p>(About 1 load and 9 ALU instructions -- 5 shifts, 2 ors, 2 ands -- with a dreadful CPU that doesn't include an inline shifter.  On many architectures these shifts might be free.)</p>

<p>The nice thing about this is that you're doing computation in parallel.</p>

<p>Okay, can we match this need?</p>

<pre><code>leftMatches = redBitsThisRow &amp; (missingLeftStone &lt;&lt; 1)
rightMatches = redBitsThisRow &amp; (missingRightStone &gt;&gt; 1)
topMatches = redBitsRow[1] &amp; missingTopOrBottomStone
bottomMatches = redBitsRow[3] &amp; missingTopOrBottomStone
</code></pre>

<p>(Another 2 loads and 6 ALU instructions -- 4 ands, 2 shifts -- with a bad CPU.  Note that row 0 and row 7 may give you trouble -- but if you've arranged things right that won't matter, just allocate two extra rows and keep a clear row above and below, and you don't need the possible branch.  This may qualify as "microoptimization", though.  :grin:)</p>

<p>And you'll probably want to do something with this stuff when you've gotten it.  This assumes a "count trailing zeros" intrinsic or very cheap inline method:</p>

<pre><code>swapType = RIGHT_TO_LEFT;
matches = leftMatches;
while ( (colIdx = ctz(matches)) &lt; WORD_BITS ) {
   // rowIdx is 2 in our examples above
   workingSwaps.insert( SwapInfo(rowIdx, colIdx, swapType) );
   // note that this SwapInfo construction could do some more advanced logic:
   //   run the swap on a temporary board and see how much score it accumulates
   //   assign some sort of value based on preferring one type of match to another, etc

   matches = matches ^ (1&lt;&lt;colIdx); // clear the match, so we can loop to the next
}
// repeat for LEFT_TO_RIGHT with rightMatches
// repeat for TOP_TO_BOTTOM with topMatches
// repeat for BOTTOM_TO_TOP with bottomMatches
</code></pre>

<p>Note that none of this bitlogic should break down in little-endian vs big-endian evironments, and I should hope your machine words are big enough to fit a row worth of bits -- 8 in this case.  =)</p>

<p>So this gets you row matches.  What about columns?  It may be easiest just to have two copies of the table, one stored in row-order and one stored in column-order.  If you have getters and setters wrapping board access, this should be trivial.  I don't mind keeping two arrays up to date, after all a set becomes <code>rowArray[y][x] = newType; colArray[x][y] = newType;</code> and that's simple.  </p>

<p>...but managing <code>rowBits[color][row]</code> and <code>colBits[color][col]</code> becomes obnoxious.</p>

<p>However, as a quick aside, if you have <code>rowBits</code> and <code>colBits</code>, you can run the <em>same code</em> with rowBits pointing at colBits instead, and you're good.  Pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code>foreach color in colors {
    foreach bits in rowBits, colBits {
        foreach row in 0..7 {
            // find starts, as above but in bits[row]
            // find missings, as above
            // generate matches, as above but in bits[row-1], bits[row], and bits[row+1]
            // loop across bits in each matches var,
            //    evaluate and/or collect them, again as above
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, what if we don't want the bother with converting a nice 2D array of bytes into bits?  With an 8x8 board and a 64-bit-capable processor, we might be able to get away with it: 8 bytes = 64 bits.  We're locked to our board width, now, but this might be fun.</p>

<p>Let's do that, then.  Assume each stone is an 8 bit byte in memory.  Assume "0" is reserved, stones begin at 1 and go to NUM_STONE_TYPES inclusive.</p>

<pre><code>startOfXXSequence = rowBytes ^ (rowBytes &lt;&lt; (8*1))
// now all bytes that are 0x00 are the start of a XX sequence

startOfXoXSequence = rowBytes ^ (rowBytes &lt;&lt; (8*2))
// all bytes that are 0x00 are the start of a XoX sequence
</code></pre>

<p>Note this doesn't need one pass per color.  In <code>BRBRBRGY</code> we'll get a startOfXoXSequence that might be something like <code>0x00 00 00 00 aa bb cc dd</code> -- the top four bytes will be zero, indicating a possible sequence starts there.</p>

<p>It's getting late, so I'll leave off here and possibly come back later -- you can continue along this vein with xors and "detect first zero byte" tricks, or you could look into some integer <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/SIMD" rel="nofollow">SIMD</a> extensions.</p>
