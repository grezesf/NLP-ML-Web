Those who do not claim to <em>know</em> the purpose at the very least like to <em>believe</em> that one exists, for a purposeless life would be thus a life without meaning, and a life without meaning does not seem to be one worth living. Whether people realize it or not, everyone's views of morality all hinge upon this idea—<strong>that there is some purpose or goal of our existence and each of our actions must be done in a way which maximizes our likelihood of reaching this goal or fulfilling our purpose.</strong> As simple as it sounds, however, there is an inherent challenge to discovering "ultimate" purpose or some universal meaning among things. Indeed, <strong>knowledge regarding the intrinsic nature of the universe is quite clearly outside the scope of human cognition, let alone scientific investigation.</strong> Just as one cannot seriously claim to know what the "First Cause" or first event of the universe was, so too can one never claim to know anything about an ultimate purpose, as one could always postulate a superior purpose. For example, one can claim the "Big Bang" is the first event, but our very concept of time implies there is always a before and after. Thus, one can conceive of an event prior to the Big Bang, perhaps initiating the Big Bang itself, and something initiating that too, and so on and so forth. This is called <em><span class="diff-delete">infinite regress</span></em><strong><span class="diff-add">infinite regress</span></strong>, and it is essentially the same problem which undermines any potential claim as to the ultimate purpose or meaning in the universe. We may conceive of the universe as an expanding bubble or crystal ball within the palm of a divine creators hand as he peers deep inside, and yet through our unbounded concept of space we will invariably ask, "What universe is this divine creator himself standing in?" Not only that, but where did <em>he</em> come from? Our very core concepts of time and space lead us to always question any ultimate beginning or ultimate endpoints, and thus—until these paradigms are changed—it seems that the answers to such questions will be forever beyond our grasp.</p><p> And yet, this new understanding does not make the concept of morality completely defunct.

Whether people realize it or not, everyone's views of morality all hinge upon this idea—<strong>that there is some purpose or goal of our existence and each of our actions must be done in a way which maximizes our likelihood of reaching this goal or fulfilling our purpose.</strong> As simple as it sounds, however, there is an inherent challenge to discovering "ultimate" purpose or some universal meaning among things. Indeed, <strong>knowledge regarding the intrinsic nature of the universe is quite clearly outside the scope of human cognition, let alone scientific investigation.</strong> Just as one cannot seriously claim to know what the "First Cause" or first event of the universe was, so too can one never claim to know anything about an ultimate purpose, as one could always postulate a superior purpose. For example, one can claim the "Big Bang" is the first event, but our very concept of time implies there is always a before and after. Thus, one can conceive of an event prior to the Big Bang, perhaps initiating the Big Bang itself, and something initiating that too, and so on and so forth. This is called <strong><span class="diff-add">infinite regress</span></strong>, and it is essentially the same problem which undermines any potential claim as to the ultimate purpose or meaning in the universe. We may conceive of the universe as an expanding bubble or crystal ball within the palm of a divine creators hand as he peers deep inside, and yet through our unbounded concept of space we will invariably ask, "What universe is this divine creator himself standing in?" Not only that, but where did <em>he</em> come from? Our very core concepts of time and space lead us to always question any ultimate beginning or ultimate endpoints, and thus—until these paradigms are changed—it seems that the answers to such questions will be forever beyond our grasp.</p><p> And yet, this new understanding does not make the concept of morality completely defunct.

            <p>The concepts of "good" and "evil" form the basis of our moral viewpoints, and we develop our these viewpoints on an individual level with influences from our cultural upbringing. That is, <strong><em>all</em> people</strong> (including the religious) <strong>take their moral viewpoints not from a book or a higher power but from an amalgamation of cultural standards and our own ratiocination</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Trouble with "Universal" or "Divine" Morality</h2>

<p>There is a natural tendency in human beings to believe that there is a <strong>purpose to our existence</strong>. Those who do not claim to <em>know</em> the purpose at the very least like to <em>believe</em> that one exists, for a purposeless life would be thus a life without meaning, and a life without meaning does not seem to be one worth living. Whether people realize it or not, everyone's views of morality all hinge upon this idea—<strong>that there is some purpose or goal of our existence and each of our actions must be done in a way which maximizes our likelihood of reaching this goal or fulfilling our purpose.</strong> As simple as it sounds, however, there is an inherent challenge to discovering "ultimate" purpose or some universal meaning among things. Indeed, <strong>knowledge regarding the intrinsic nature of the universe is quite clearly outside the scope of human cognition, let alone scientific investigation.</strong> Just as one cannot seriously claim to know what the "First Cause" or first event of the universe was, so too can one never claim to know anything about an ultimate purpose, as one could always postulate a superior purpose. For example, one can claim the "Big Bang" is the first event, but our very concept of time implies there is always a before and after. Thus, one can conceive of an event prior to the Big Bang, perhaps initiating the Big Bang itself, and something initiating that too, and so on and so forth. This is called <em>infinite regress</em>, and it is essentially the same problem which undermines any potential claim as to the ultimate purpose or meaning in the universe. We may conceive of the universe as an expanding bubble or crystal ball within the palm of a divine creators hand as he peers deep inside, and yet through our unbounded concept of space we will invariably ask, "What universe is this divine creator himself standing in?" Not only that, but where did <em>he</em> come from? Our very core concepts of time and space lead us to always question any ultimate beginning or ultimate endpoints, and thus—until these paradigms are changed—it seems that the answers to such questions will be forever beyond our grasp.</p>

<p>And yet, this new understanding does not make the concept of morality completely defunct. It simply moves the concept of morality from its prior <em>universal</em> pedestal to the pedestal of <em>social contingency</em>. That is, the morality we speak of is not a phenomenon of the universe itself but of social groups<sup>1</sup>. Contrary to one's initial reaction to this finding, being contingent and <em>not</em> universal actually makes our task much easier; for imagine if we had to set out to investigate that which underlies the fabric of the universe? Again, a virtually impossible task. What is left for us instead is to find out what provides the basis for the widespread (although not completely universal) human tendency towards a moral state, what bearing it has in relation to our evolutionary past, and how we can use this knowledge to better ourselves.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <sub>Extra care was taken here not to say "human" social groups, as morality surely exists in non-human animal species to varying degrees (Brosnan, 2010; Haan, 1982), and it is conceivable that even an alien race would abide by a moral code.</sub></p>

<h2>God/the Bible is actually not a source of morality</h2>

<p>The first part to my answer already shows why God cannot be a source of morality, and many people have spoken of the moral shortcomings of the Bible so I won't belabor the point too much. Sam Harris in <em>Letter to a Christian Nation</em>, puts it best when he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The idea that the Bible is a perfect guide to morality is simply
  astounding, given the contents of the book. God’s counsel to parents
  is straightforward: whenever children get out of line, we should <strong>beat
  them with a rod</strong> (Proverbs 13:24, 20:30, and 23:13-14). If they are
  shameless enough to talk back to us, <strong>we should kill them</strong> (Leviticus
  20:9, Deuteronomy 21:18-21, Mark 7:9-13, and Matthew 15:4-7). We must
  also <strong>stone people to death</strong> for heresy, adultery, homosexuality,
  working on the Sabbath, worshiping graven images, practicing sorcery,
  and a wide variety of other imaginary crimes. (p. 8)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would add to that by pointing out that <strong>the Bible supports the practice of slavery in both the New</strong> (Matthew 10:24/24:45-46, Ephesians 6:5, 1 Timothy 6:1-4) <strong>and Old Testaments</strong>. The Bible even tells us we are free to <strong>sell our daughters into slavery</strong>, and the things we can’t do to our slaves is <strong>beat them so much that they go blind or lose their teeth</strong> (Exodus 21:26-27).</p>

<p><em><strong>Fortunately</em></strong>, for religious folk this isn't necessarily a game-breaker. You can still believe in God and understand that God designed you in a way such that you can come to your own conclusions about what's right and wrong. Most people shouldn't have a problem with this.</p>

<h2>So where then does morality come from?</h2>

<p>Psychologists have actually studied this for a while now. Although <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Piaget" rel="nofollow">Jean Piaget</a> was one of the earliest recognized to have developed a set of stages for moral development in children, it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg" rel="nofollow">Lawrence Kohlberg</a> who would later develop the famous <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development" rel="nofollow">6 stages of moral development</a></strong> still used today in psychological instruments and research. Although they have undergone some revision since they were first published over fifty years ago, they have been heavily verified by research over the years and remain the dominant theory today regarding moral development from childhood through adulthood.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z5CEi.png" alt="Kohlberg's Stages of Moral Development"></p>

<p>What studies consistently find is that <strong>people of even similar backgrounds and faiths will vary markedly with regard to their "stage"</strong>, further confirming that there is no set standard or law that everyone draws from, even from within the same religion or culture. </p>

<h2>What we have found in the past fifty years of moral development research is that the greatest predictor being in the advanced moral stages is not religious or spiritual views but <em>level of education</em> and <em>intelligence</em>.</h2>

<p>What does this mean? It means you're a moral person because you're smart, not because you're blindly following orders. :-)</p>
