            <p> Many lifters, particularly novices, need to focus at least some of their attention on hypertrophy and mass gain in order to have a sufficient muscle mass to make strong. I'm not sure if it's appropriate for intermediates and beyond. I'm also not sure if this would call for a sarcoplasmic hypertrophy phase (in which I imagine one would focus on 10-12 rep sets), or simply doing sets of 5-6 reps instead of 1-3 reps.</p>

<h2>Cross-Sectional Area</h2>

<p> There are specific structural benefits of having bigger muscles. For one, they provide more space for muscles to operate:</p>

  <p> The cross-sectional area of a muscle (rather than volume or length) determines the amount of force it can generate by defining the number of sarcomeres which can operate in parallel.</p>

<p> I believe that Jim Wendler has been quoted on a minimum bodyweight that he believes is necessary to "look like you lift weights" as well as to have the correct body proportions to perform the powerlifting lifts optimally. (I think it was around 220 but I can't find the reference.) </p>

<p> The second part of that is relevant. (Since I can't find it, I'll try to relate a picture I remember from Starting Strength 2nd Edition.) Envision an underdeveloped thigh from the side. Since it is relatively thin, the forces applied by the quadriceps and the hamstrings are not far apart. Now envision a well-developed thigh. Its mass widens the space between the two forces, making a longer and more efficient lever arm. Think of trying to close a door by pushing it close to the hinges, as opposed to pushing it near the handle. </p>
