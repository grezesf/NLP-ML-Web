I have considered to delete the question instead, but apparently it triggered one user to assess and resolve the lack of private API badge assignment to him, so there appear to be some useful outcome of my procrastinations at least ;)</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong>:<br>
I have been looking at this topic with the assumption that the private API beta worked just like the Stack Exchange 2.0 private betas, where all activities are at the target host starting from day one and only the access barrier is lowered over time. However, if I read things correctly now, the private API beta has been hosted on a separate site, which got migrated to Stack Apps later on with manual steps involved.</p>

<ul>
<li> yields 3 users being rewarded the <code>API Evangelist</code> badge, where some <em>don't have any posts before May 21</em> (start of public API beta) and some <strong>don't have any posts at all</strong> - see my related question <a href="http://stackapps.com/questions/1382/what-constitutes-active-participation-in-the-private-api-beta">What constitutes 'active participation' in the private API beta?</a></li>
<li> yields 5 users being rewarded the <code>API Beta</code> badge, where some are a <em>member as of May 21 or even June only</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p> Maybe the whole registration/membership has been reset after the private beta and the badges are triggered by the next visit only, but this doesn't explain the <code>API Evangelist</code> badges and could qualify as a confusing bug in the 'member for' display at least. Besides, looking at the <a href="http://stackapps.com/badges/60/api-evangelist"><code>API Evangelist</code> badges</a> in isolation yields users with posts after May 20 only and <strong>no posts or no activity at all even</strong>.</p>

<li> Maybe the whole registration/membership has been reset after the private beta and the badges are triggered by the next visit only, but again, this doesn't explain the <code>API Evangelist</code> badges and would qualify as a confusing bug in the 'member for' display at least.</li>
<li> Looking at the <a href="http://stackapps.com/badges/60/api-evangelist"><code>API Evangelist</code> badges</a> in isolation yields users with posts after May 20 only and <strong>no posts or no activity at all even</strong>.</li>
