            <h2>Repeatable? Definitely.</h2>

<p> Using the same film, cross-processing has perfectly repeatable results, but it helps to be specific:  <strong>the negatives</strong> will turn out the same, positives (virtually always scans) may not, and it's the positives you see on Flickr and elsewhere.</p>

<p> The reasons for this are pretty simple: both the film emulsions and processing chemistry (both E-6 and C-41) are highly standardised.  If either one changed unexpectedly to any degree, you'd get unpredictable results regardless of whether you were cross-processing.</p>

<p> Scans (especially of E-6 in C-41, but the reverse as well to some degree) admit much more variation - if done at the lab, it depends on the machine, it's presets, how much effort the operator takes, and whether they're familiar with cross-processed negatives.  When people scan at home, they might do so with different goals in mind - some may want the extreme colour casts, some may prefer to correct the image to almost "normal", and anywhere in between.  The results are like you see: the same film (even the same image) can have wildly varying results depending on its treatment.</p>

<p> I should add that this is true to some degree of any negative film – there is always much more room for variation in the colour balance and treatment when converting to positive than when shooting direct positive film.</p>

<h2>Why? Good question.</h2>

<p> I don't think there's a general answer to "why" - often it's just a matter of enjoying the look (like with any other film/technique), following a fad (they've happened a few times), or even not having easy access to E-6 processing.  If there is a general reason "why," then I don't think it's significantly different to any other film.  For example,<span class="diff-delete"> cross-processed</span><span class="diff-add"> original</span> Agfa Precisa<span class="diff-delete"> yielded</span><sup><span class="diff-add">1</span></sup> <span class="diff-add">yielded</span> a high-contrast image with exaggerated blues, but otherwise mostly neutral colour shifts, and an almost-clear base.  As a result, it was reputedly used for commercial shots of blue jeans.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p> The above makes "realistic" examples difficult, but here's some mine (otherwise it's impossible to comment on processing/lighting) to display the kind of range you can get, shot on Precisa:</p>

            <h2>Repeatable? Definitely.</h2>

<p> Using the same film, cross-processing has perfectly repeatable results, but it helps to be specific:  <strong>the negatives</strong> will turn out the same, positives (virtually always scans) may not, and it's the positives you see on Flickr and elsewhere.</p>

<p> The reasons for this are pretty simple: both the film emulsions and processing chemistry (both E-6 and C-41) are highly standardised.  If either one changed unexpectedly to any degree, you'd get unpredictable results regardless of whether you were cross-processing.</p>

<p> Scans (especially of E-6 in C-41, but the reverse as well to some degree) admit much more variation - if done at the lab, it depends on the machine, it's presets, how much effort the operator takes, and whether they're familiar with cross-processed negatives.  When people scan at home, they might do so with different goals in mind - some may want the extreme colour casts, some may prefer to correct the image to almost "normal", and anywhere in between.  The results are like you see: the same film (even the same image) can have wildly varying results depending on its treatment.</p>

<p> I should add that this is true to some degree of any negative film – there is always much more room for variation in the colour balance and treatment when converting to positive than when shooting direct positive film.</p>

<h2>Why? Good question.</h2>

<p> I don't think there's a general answer to "why" - often it's just a matter of enjoying the look (like with any other film/technique), following a fad (they've happened a few times), or even not having easy access to E-6 processing.  If there is a general reason "why," then I don't think it's significantly different to any other film.  For example, cross-processed Agfa Precisa yielded a high-contrast image with exaggerated blues, but otherwise mostly neutral colour shifts, and an almost-clear base.  As a result, it was reputedly used for commercial shots of blue jeans.</p>

                <p> Using the same film, cross-processing has perfectly repeatable results, but it helps to be specific:  <strong>the negatives</strong> will turn out the same, positives (virtually always scans) may not, and it's the positives you see on Flickr and elsewhere.</p>

<p> The reasons for this are pretty simple: both the film emulsions and processing chemistry (both E-6 and C-41) are highly standardised.  If either one changed unexpectedly to any degree, you'd get unpredictable results regardless of whether you were cross-processing.</p>

<p> Scans admit much more variation - if done at the lab, it depends on the machine, it's presets, how much effort the operator takes, and whether they're familiar with cross-processed negatives.  When people scan at home, they might do so with different goals in mind - some may want the extreme colour casts, some may prefer to correct the image to almost "normal", and anywhere in between.  The results are like you see: the same film (even the same image) can have wildly varying results depending on its treatment.</p>
