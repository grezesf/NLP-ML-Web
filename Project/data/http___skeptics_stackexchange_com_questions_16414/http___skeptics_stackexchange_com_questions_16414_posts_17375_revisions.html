</span></blockquote>

<p> Let’s analyze the above paragraph as below:</p>

<p> The phrase, Christians believe that the individual soul is a direct creation by God, as mentioned above gives us the truth of God’s direct involvement in creation of individual soul.  As the phrase, there is no intrinsic conflict between Christianity and the theory of evolution, is mentioned before the phrase, PROVIDED that Christians believe that the individual soul is a direct creation of God, it gives us the conclusion that Paul Pius XII only supported evolutionary theory provided that it supports individual soul was a direct creation of God.  However, evolutionary theory does not support individual soul was the direct creation of God.  Instead, it supports that God only assisted in the evolution instead of He created individual soul by Himself directly.  Indeed, evolution assumes material force, i.e. natural selection, that causes one animal to be transformed into another.  </p>

<p> As the phrase, provided that, has been stressed before the phrase, Christians believe that the individual soul is a direct creation by God and not the product of purely material forces (natural selection), it gives us a conclusion that Paul only encourages Christians to believe in evolution on the condition if it supports that God was a direct creator of individual soul, and that each of the creation was not the result of the product or the end-result of purely material force, such as, natural selection that drove the animals to be transformed.</p>

<p> As evolutionary theory does not support a direct creation from God and that it supports that it was the end-result of purely material force, such as, natural selection that drove animals to transform, Paul Pius XII did not call Christians to support evolutionary theory.  </p>

<p> Paul Pius XII only called Christians to support evolutionary theory only if the teaching supports that it was God that created individual soul.  Besides, they have to support that the existence of individual soul was not the product of material force but God’s direct creation.</p>

<p> Nevertheless, Paul Pius XII did not support evolutionary theory since this teaching does not support God’s direct creation.  Besides, this teaching supports the end-result of evolution was the product of material force, such as, natural selection, that drove animals to transform.</p>
