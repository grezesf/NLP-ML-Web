</span></blockquote><p><span class="diff-add"> Wikipedia's article on "Encyclical" in fact quotes from Humani Generis, which says:</span></p><blockquote><span class="diff-add">
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> [19.] Although these things seem well said, still they are not free form error. It is true that Popes generally leave theologians free in those matters which are disputed in various ways by men of very high authority in this field; but history teaches that many matters that formerly were open to discussion, no longer now admit of discussion.</span></p><span class="diff-add">
  
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> [20.] Nor must it be thought that what is expounded in Encyclical Letters does not of itself demand consent, since in writing such Letters the Popes do not exercise the supreme power of their Teaching Authority. For these matters are taught with the ordinary teaching authority, of which it is true to say: "He who heareth you, heareth me";[3] and generally what is expounded and inculcated in Encyclical Letters already for other reasons appertains to Catholic doctrine. But if the Supreme Pontiffs in their official documents purposely pass judgment on a matter up to that time under dispute, it is obvious that that matter, according to the mind and will of the Pontiffs, cannot be any longer considered a question open to discussion among theologians.</span></p><span class="diff-add">
</span></blockquote><p><span class="diff-add"> Using this to interpret paragraph 36 which I quoted above, I think I understand that (the rest of this paragraph is in my own words and I may be using some words such as 'heresy' inaccurately) whereas Darwin's theories used to be ridiculed and dismissed as incompatible with religious belief, Pius was carefully and deliberately saying that the theory of evolution is not necessarily a heresy (but neither should it be taken atheist). I think I therefore agree with the following summary from Wikipedia about </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species#Religious_attitudes" rel="nofollow"><span class="diff-add">Religious attitudes to On The Origin of Species</span></a><span class="diff-add">:</span></p><blockquote><span class="diff-add">
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> By the early 20th century, four noted authors of The Fundamentals were explicitly open to the possibility that God created through evolution, but fundamentalism inspired the American creation–evolution controversy that began in the 1920s. Some conservative Roman Catholic writers and influential Jesuits opposed evolution in the late 19th and early 20th century, but other Catholic writers, starting with Mivart, pointed out that </span><strong><span class="diff-add">early Church Fathers had not interpreted Genesis literally in this area</span></strong><span class="diff-add">. The Vatican stated its official position in a 1950 papal encyclical, which held that </span><strong><span class="diff-add">evolution was not inconsistent with Catholic teaching</span></strong><span class="diff-add">.</span></p><span class="diff-add">
</span></blockquote><hr><p><span class="diff-add"> For what it's worth, </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentalism" rel="nofollow"><span class="diff-add">Fundamentalism seems to be centred in the USA</span></a><span class="diff-add">. Ad Hominem isn't an argument, however it doesn't surprise me that the "dissenting view" which is cited in the OP comes from the USA. I'm surprised that a person takes this sermon as very authoritative, given that it starts with "By the authority invested in my own mind, etc."</span></p><p><span class="diff-add"> A lot of that sermon seems to be his own opinion of or summary from the many things he has read. I won't debate its every statement in detail. The only or most reliable source in the sermon that he quotes is paragraph 37 of Humanis Generis (the next one after the paragraph 36 which I quoted above), saying,</span></p><blockquote><span class="diff-add">
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> “The faithful cannot embrace that opinion that men came from someone other than Adam and Eve or that Adam and Eve represent a collection of many first parents. Thus God created one man and from that one man, woman was created and all of mankind was created from them.” (Paragraph 37)</span></p><span class="diff-add">
</span></blockquote><p><span class="diff-add"> The full, original text is as follows:</span></p><blockquote><span class="diff-add">
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> [37.] When, however, there is question of another conjectural opinion, namely polygenism, the children of the Church by no means enjoy such liberty. For the faithful cannot embrace that opinion which maintains that either after Adam there existed on this earth true men who did not take their origin through natural generation from him as from the first parent of all, or that Adam represents a certain number of first parents. Now it is in no way apparent how such an opinion can be reconciled with that which the sources of revealed truth and the documents of the Teaching Authority of the Church propose with regard to original sin, which proceeds from a sin actually committed by an individual Adam and which, through generation, is passed on to all and is in everyone as his own.</span></p><span class="diff-add">
</span></blockquote><p><span class="diff-add"> My personal synthesis or explanation of the Church's position (I am not an expert nor authoritative, so you might instead want to ask someone who is, to explain this) is therefore:</span></p><ul><span class="diff-add">
</span><li><span class="diff-add"> Evolution explains the evolution of the human body, more or less successfully</span></li><span class="diff-add">
</span><li><span class="diff-add"> God creates human souls</span></li><span class="diff-add">
</span><li><span class="diff-add"> The first human (with a soul) was Adam; Adam had original sin; all humans descend from and inherit original sin from Adam; Christ came to save us from original sin; etc.</span></li>

Ad Hominem isn't an argument, however it doesn't surprise me that the "dissenting view" which is cited in the OP comes from the USA. I'm surprised that a person takes this sermon as very authoritative, given that it starts with "By the authority invested in my own mind, etc."</span></p><p><span class="diff-add"> A lot of that sermon seems to be his own opinion of or summary from the many things he has read. I won't debate its every statement in detail. The only or most reliable source in the sermon that he quotes is paragraph 37 of Humanis Generis (the next one after the paragraph 36 which I quoted above), saying,</span></p><blockquote><span class="diff-add">
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> “The faithful cannot embrace that opinion that men came from someone other than Adam and Eve or that Adam and Eve represent a collection of many first parents. Thus God created one man and from that one man, woman was created and all of mankind was created from them.” (Paragraph 37)</span></p><span class="diff-add">
</span></blockquote><p><span class="diff-add"> The full, original text is as follows:</span></p><blockquote><span class="diff-add">
  </span><p><span class="diff-add"> [37.] When, however, there is question of another conjectural opinion, namely polygenism, the children of the Church by no means enjoy such liberty. For the faithful cannot embrace that opinion which maintains that either after Adam there existed on this earth true men who did not take their origin through natural generation from him as from the first parent of all, or that Adam represents a certain number of first parents. Now it is in no way apparent how such an opinion can be reconciled with that which the sources of revealed truth and the documents of the Teaching Authority of the Church propose with regard to original sin, which proceeds from a sin actually committed by an individual Adam and which, through generation, is passed on to all and is in everyone as his own.</span></p><span class="diff-add">
</span></blockquote><p><span class="diff-add"> My personal synthesis or explanation of the Church's position (I am not an expert nor authoritative, so you might instead want to ask someone who is, to explain this) is therefore:</span></p><ul><span class="diff-add">
</span><li><span class="diff-add"> Evolution explains the evolution of the human body, more or less successfully</span></li><span class="diff-add">
</span><li><span class="diff-add"> God creates human souls</span></li><span class="diff-add">
</span><li><span class="diff-add"> The first human (with a soul) was Adam; Adam had original sin; all humans descend from and inherit original sin from Adam; Christ came to save us from original sin; etc.</span></li>
