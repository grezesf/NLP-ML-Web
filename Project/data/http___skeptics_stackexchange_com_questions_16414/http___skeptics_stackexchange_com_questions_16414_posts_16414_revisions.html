                <p> Or, is Bill O'Reilly a heretic?</p>

<p> In his 2007 video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&amp;v=KnJX68ELbAY&amp;feature=endscreen" rel="nofollow">1st Foundational Falsehood of Creationism</a> the YouTuber AronRa claims</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> [Catholicism and Orthodoxy] have stated support of evolution and denounced creationism. Pope Benedict recently described evolution as an enriching reality and described creationist contest against it as absurd. Both of the popes before him advised Christians around the world to consider evolution to be more than a hypothesis and not to fear and not t fear acceptance of that is being any challenge to their faith in Christ"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(4:56-5:16)</p>

<p> I have heard this argument from other atheist sources, like Pen &amp; Teller, Richard Dawkins and others, but I can't find those sources at the moment.</p>

<p> On the other hand Bill O'Reilly, a self proclaimed Roman Catholic, doesn't seem to believe in evolution. As can be seen in the video on <a href="http://sensuouscurmudgeon.wordpress.com/2011/01/31/bill-oreilly-flaming-full-blown-creationist/" rel="nofollow">this page</a>. I took him because he's the most obnoxious and famous example for an "anti science" catholic. But there are other Catholics that reject evolution<sup>1</sup>:</p>

<p><a href="http://catholicism.org/a-sermon-against-evolution.html" rel="nofollow">A catholic sermon against evolution</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qroQSbMFplw" rel="nofollow">A video depicting several catholic people who appose and support evolution</a></p>

<p> And there are others.</p>

<p> On the other hand some resources claim that there is no contrediction between catholism and evolution, like <a href="http://www.americancatholic.org/Newsletters/CU/preview.aspx?id=236" rel="nofollow">this article</a> from  AmericanCatholic.org:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> The relatively simple scientific theory of evolution met with resistance, not only when it appeared in 1859, but also today. In this Catholic Update, we will explore the reasons for this resistance and why <strong>the theory of evolution is not inconsistent with Catholic teaching.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="diff-add"> Or miss Minnisota from the famous </span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRdAe3UAIVs" rel="nofollow"><span class="diff-add">"should evolution be taught in schools video"</span></a> <span class="diff-add">(5:00) who claims that her [Catholic] priest thaght them that evolution doesn't go against the Catholic faith and that Pope John Paul II accepted it.</span></p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p> But all the non atheist sources, including the relevant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_and_evolution" rel="nofollow">Wiki page</a>, that I have seen seem to be unwilling to admit that the official stance of the Vatican, the Pope and the Holy See is that evolution is the accepted theory by the catholic church for the process by which god created Humans and all living creatures<sup>2</sup> (Or something like this). Which is what the atheist videos try to say/imply.</p>

<p> So what is the official teaching of the church?</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Is evolution regarded as the only truth and that all catholic should accept it, like gravity or Heliocentrism?</p></li>
<li><p> Is evolution regarded as false, and believing is herassy, like believing that Marry wasn't a virgin or Jesus was/isn't god/the son of god?</p></li>
<li><p> Is it unresolved and each believer can choose whether to accept it or not?</p></li>
<li><p> Something else...</p></li>
</ul>
