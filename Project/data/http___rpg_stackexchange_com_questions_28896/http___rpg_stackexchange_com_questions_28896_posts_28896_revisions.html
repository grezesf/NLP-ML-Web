            <p> I am currently having difficulty finding a solution to long distance traveling in D&amp;D 3.5, I don't want to just skip the time it takes to get from one place to another but I also don't want to move at 30 feet per round rolling random encounters. I have a complete map of all of Faerûn and have detailed information about every town, place or old ruin ect. but there are a lot of roads and empty forests to travel through. Over mountains and through caves, I understand that the surface world is not as dangerous to travel over as the Under-dark is but it still is wrought with peril! Bandits, Hobgoblin Raiders, Bugbears, Giberlings, the uncommon Dragon ect... </p>

<ul>
<li><p> I am asking if anyone has any ideas about a system that will lend itself to changes in territory and landscape with scaled CR encounters for the party to travel the world and still not reach ungodly levels by having over 1,000 random encounters before the next dungeon they reach.</p></li>
<li><p> I also do not want to just skip travel or pass it off as nothing to bother about, traveling the world from Waterdeep to the Moonsea is a experience of a life time for a lower level party and a simple teleportation spell for higher levels.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="diff-delete"> The system I am asking for is to use random tables and dice to determine the random adventure they will have on their journey that is easy to accept and run for low levels and those who bother to travel at higher levels.</span></p></li><span class="diff-delete">
</span><li><p> I currently am using random encounter tables(Silver Marches for North), (Shining South for South), (Unapproachable East for East) and the DMG for filler and Western lands making the travel just a bunch of random encounters re-imagined for each area this is not satisfactory for my realism of the world. </p></li>
</ul>

<p> I am trying to be fair to the players (reward exploration and battles fought without letting them grind their way through levels.) It should be worth something to brave the journey across the Sea of Fallen Stars, but if that is just the way the party has to get into the next location in the adventure then it should not level them 5 times before they start. </p>

<ul>
<li> I could easily make the voyage across the Sea a stand-alone adventure but then I could do that to every road and every hill...</li>
</ul>

            <p> I am currently having difficulty finding a solution to long distance traveling in D&amp;D 3.5, I don't want to just skip the time it takes to get from one place to another but I also don't want to move at 30 feet per round rolling random encounters. I have a complete map of all of Faerûn and have detailed information about every town, place or old ruin ect. but there are a lot of roads and empty forests to travel through. Over mountains and through caves, I understand that the surface world is not as dangerous to travel over as the Under-dark is but it still is wrought with<span class="diff-delete"> pearl</span><span class="diff-add"> peril</span>!
