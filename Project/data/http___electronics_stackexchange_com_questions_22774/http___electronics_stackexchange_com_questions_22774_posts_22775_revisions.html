<p> Consider a moderately fit person to be one who could walk briskly on a level surface for an hour and be tired but not utterly exhausted in the process. ie not super athletic in capabilities and not even "extremely fit" - but well above "couch potato" fitness. </p>

<hr>

<p> Using a good quality alternator a moderately fit user can supply 50 Watts mean for an hour. This is a level at which you definitely know that you are exercising but it would be bearable for many. </p>

<p> The same moderately fit user could supply 100 Watts for an hour and be extremely tired. </p>

<p> if you were aiming at a frequent powering task, 50 Watts would be far preferable to 100 Watts.</p>

<p> The above assumes a good quality reasonable efficiency system. Ideally with minimal "cogging" or saliency - ie no slow speed jerkiness to drive as magnets approach and recede from coils. Some systems use generators with substantial gearing ratios using chain drive. These could be reasonable but usually aren't. Belt drive to a low saliency alternator can be made to work well.</p>

<p> Note that the claims made on the website provided tend to contradict themself.  I'd estimate the mean output as shown on that graph as being 60 - 70 Watts range. Their graph:</p>

<p> And Finally - Someone who is a competitive cycler can put out up to 500 Watts!!</p></li>
</ul>
