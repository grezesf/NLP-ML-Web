<p> You could probably get by with just the first of those two. I haven't been a big fan of the "for dummies" series in the past, but I found both of these were quite good, particularly for people who have little understanding of investing.</p>

<p> I also rather like the site, <a href="http://canadiancouchpotato.com/" rel="nofollow">Canadian Couch Potato</a>. That has a wealth of information on passive investing using mutual funds and ETFs. It's a good next step after reading one or the other of the books above.</p>

<p> In your specific case, you are investing for the fairly short term and your tolerance for risk seems to be quite low. Gold is a high-risk investment, and in my opinion is ill-suited to your investment goals. I'd say you are looking at a money market account (very low risk, low return) such as e.g. the TD Canadian Money Market fund (TDB164). You may also want to take a look at e.g. the TD Canadian Bond Index (TDB909) which is only slightly higher risk.</p>

<p> However, for someone just starting out and without a whack of knowledge, I rather like pointing people at the <a href="http://www.ingdirect.ca/en/mutualfunds/index.html" rel="nofollow">ING Direct Streetwise Funds</a>. They offer three options, balancing risk vs reward. You can fill in their <a href="http://www.ingdirect.ca/en/mutualfunds/investorprofile/index.html" rel="nofollow">online fund selector</a> and it'll point you in the right direction. You can pay less by buying individual stock and bond funds through your bank (following e.g. one of the <a href="http://canadiancouchpotato.com/model-portfolios/" rel="nofollow">Canadian Couch Potato's model portfolios</a>), but ING Direct makes things nice and simple, and is a good option for people who don't care to spend a lot of time on this.</p>

<p> Note that I am not a financial adviser, and I have only a limited understanding of your needs. You may want to consult one, though you'll want to be careful when doing so to avoid just talking to a salesperson. Also, note that I am biased toward passive index investing. Other people may recommend that you invest in gold or real estate or specific stocks. I think that's a bad idea and believe I have the science to back this up, but I may be wrong.</p>

        <div class="post-text">
            <p>I got started by reading the following two books:
* <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Investing-Canadians-Dummies-Third-Martin/dp/0470160292/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350743182&amp;sr=8-4" rel="nofollow">Investing for Canadians for Dummies (3rd Edition)</a>
* <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Mutual-Fund-Investing-Canadians-Dummies/dp/047015764X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350743194&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">Mutual Fund Investing for Canadians for Dummies</a></p>

<p>You could probably get by with just the first of those two. I haven't been a big fan of the "for dummies" series in the past, but I found both of these were quite good, particularly for people who have little understanding of investing.</p>

<p>I also rather like the site, <a href="http://canadiancouchpotato.com/" rel="nofollow">Canadian Couch Potato</a>. That has a wealth of information on passive investing using mutual funds and ETFs. It's a good next step after reading one or the other of the books above.</p>

<p>In your specific case, you are investing for the fairly short term and your tolerance for risk seems to be quite low. Gold is a high-risk investment, and in my opinion is ill-suited to your investment goals. I'd say you are looking at a money market account (very low risk, low return) such as e.g. the TD Canadian Money Market fund (TDB164). You may also want to take a look at e.g. the TD Canadian Bond Index (TDB909) which is only slightly higher risk.</p>

<p>However, for someone just starting out and without a whack of knowledge, I rather like pointing people at the <a href="http://www.ingdirect.ca/en/mutualfunds/index.html" rel="nofollow">ING Direct Streetwise Funds</a>. They offer three options, balancing risk vs reward. You can fill in their <a href="http://www.ingdirect.ca/en/mutualfunds/investorprofile/index.html" rel="nofollow">online fund selector</a> and it'll point you in the right direction. You can pay less by buying individual stock and bond funds through your bank (following e.g. one of the <a href="http://canadiancouchpotato.com/model-portfolios/" rel="nofollow">Canadian Couch Potato's model portfolios</a>), but ING Direct makes things nice and simple, and is a good option for people who don't care to spend a lot of time on this.</p>

<p>Note that I am not a financial adviser, and I have only a limited understanding of your needs. You may want to consult one, though you'll want to be careful when doing so to avoid just talking to a salesperson. Also, note that I am biased toward passive index investing. Other people may recommend that you invest in gold or real estate or specific stocks. I think that's a bad idea and believe I have the science to back this up, but I may be wrong.</p>
