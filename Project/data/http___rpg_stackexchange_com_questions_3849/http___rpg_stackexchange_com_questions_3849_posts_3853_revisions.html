            <p> These are all games I've run or played as instant, one-evening games, and had fun with.</p>

<p> We greatly enjoyed <a href="http://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/64016/fiasco" rel="nofollow">Fiasco</a>, which is designed for playing in a single evening from beginning to end. The book is somewhat set up to teach the rules as you read, although we found that having one or two players who had already read the rules made things much smoother. Character creation is quick and part of the game, not preparation for it, so you can start cold and finish in good time. I set up an evening of Fiasco for an experienced roleplayer, two never-roleplayed-before friends, and myself, and it was great fun.</p>

<p> We played <a href="http://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/54318/zombie-cinema" rel="nofollow">Zombie Cinema</a> the same way. The rules for this are short enough that everyone can read them before you start, and character creation is as fast as drawing three cards and telling everyone what your character looks like. It manages to make character death an <em>entertaining</em> part of the game, which incidentally also promotes that player to GM-like status so they can keep playing. And it has zombies.</p>

Character creation is dead simple (one minute, tops), and you can literally do any kind of game with it. It requires no preparation and is very free-wheeling. The rules are also simple enough (8 sentences) that you can keep them in your head while GMing. It's a great backup game that requires nothing more than the rules in your head, a handful of d6, paper, and pencils.</span></p><span class="diff-add">

Although it's designed to be an ongoing game, it's just as much fun played as an instant game. I'm going to be running this as a one-shot for three players in November.

            <p>These are all games I've run or played as instant, one-evening games, and had fun with.</p>

<p>We greatly enjoyed <a href="http://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/64016/fiasco" rel="nofollow">Fiasco</a>, which is designed for playing in a single evening from beginning to end. The book is somewhat set up to teach the rules as you read, although we found that having one or two players who had already read the rules made things much smoother. Character creation is quick and part of the game, not preparation for it, so you can start cold and finish in good time. I set up an evening of Fiasco for an experienced roleplayer, two never-roleplayed-before friends, and myself, and it was great fun.</p>

<p>We played <a href="http://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/54318/zombie-cinema" rel="nofollow">Zombie Cinema</a> the same way. The rules for this are short enough that everyone can read them before you start, and character creation is as fast as drawing three cards and telling everyone what your character looks like. It manages to make character death an <em>entertaining</em> part of the game, which incidentally also promotes that player to GM-like status so they can keep playing. And it has zombies.</p>

<p><a href="http://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/73502/apocalypse-world" rel="nofollow">Apocalypse World</a> is a hefty 300-page game, but once the GM knows the rules, it requires (actually, it <em>demands</em>) zero prep for both players and GM. Although it's designed to be an ongoing game, it's just as much fun played as an instant game. I'm going to be running this as a one-shot for three players in November. The only downside to playing this as an instant game is that character sheets are necessary (they're the instant-start "rulebooks" for the players), so a little bit of physical prep is required.</p>

<p>There is also the strange little game dubbed <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11348" rel="nofollow">Roll For Shoes</a> that we had a lot of fun with one evening. Character creation is dead simple (one minute, tops), and you can literally do any kind of game with it. It requires no preparation and is very free-wheeling. The rules are also simple enough (8 sentences) that you can keep them in your head while GMing. It's a great backup game that requires nothing more than the rules in your head, a handful of d6, paper, and pencils.</p>
