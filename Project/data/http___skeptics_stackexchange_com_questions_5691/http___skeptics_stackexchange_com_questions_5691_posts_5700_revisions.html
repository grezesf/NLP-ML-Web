            <p> This is known as "The Mozart Effect," and its effects are only temporary...</p>

<p> CBC Radio interviewed Dr. Rauscher on 2010-Jul-01 on their show "As it happens," where she talked about her study (<em>which elicited emotional responses, including a few death threats</em>) and also explained how the effects were only temporary for specific spatial tasks.  You can listen to this interview by <em>tuning in</em> to CBC Radio's web site:</p>

&nbsp; (<em>Play part 1, and skip ahead to "19 minutes" for the interview</em>)</p>

<p> More details about "The Mozart Effect" can also be found at <a href="http://lrs.ed.uiuc.edu/students/lerch1/edpsy/mozart_effect.html" rel="nofollow">http://lrs.ed.uiuc.edu/students/lerch1/edpsy/mozart_effect.html</a> where, in particular, the following two paragraphs about the relevant studies seem to help to answer the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> He later joined two other researchers, Frances Rauscher and Katherine Ky, in creating the study that coined the term "Mozart Effect". In the October 14, 1993, issue of "Nature" they published a short summary of the findings from their experiment. They assigned thirty six Cal-Irvine students to one of three groups, and offered the same "pretest" to each of the students. One group then listened to a selection by Mozart (Sonata in D major for Two Pianos, K488). A second group listened to what was called a "relaxation tape," and the third group was subjected to ten minutes of silence. All of the students were given the same test, which was designed to measure spatial IQ. This test is described as mentally unfolding a piece of paper is that has been folded over several times and then cut. The object is to correctly select the final unfolded paper shape from five examples. The students who listened to the Mozart sonata averaged an 8&endash;9 point increase in their IQ as compared to the average of the students who had listened to the relaxation tape or who had experienced silence. The increase in IQ of the Mozart group was transitory, lasting only about the time it took to take the test-- from ten to fifteen minutes. </p>
  
  <p> This test stirred enough interest in the academic community to induce several other research teams to conduct similar experiments, with disparate results.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> Additionally, the media played a big hand in the creation of the misinformation, according to the interview, when they used Dr. Rauscher's explanations out of context to the point of mis-quoting her as concluding that <em>rock music is bad</em> when what she really said was that she hadn't conducted any studies on rock music (she did get a free T-Shirt from the famous rock group <em>Nirvana</em> though, with all the band members' signatures on it as appreciation for the free publicity).</p>

            <p>This is known as "The Mozart Effect," and its effects are only temporary...</p>

<p>CBC Radio interviewed Dr. Rauscher on 2010-Jul-01 on their show "As it happens," where she talked about her study (<em>which elicited emotional responses, including a few death threats</em>) and also explained how the effects were only temporary for specific spatial tasks.  You can listen to this interview by <em>tuning in</em> to CBC Radio's web site:</p>

<p>&nbsp; <strong>CBC Radio - As it happens - July 1st, 2010 episode</strong><br>
&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/asithappens/episode/2010/07/01/july-1-2010/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbc.ca/asithappens/episode/2010/07/01/july-1-2010/</a><br>
&nbsp; (<em>Play part 1, and skip ahead to "19 minutes" for the interview</em>)</p>

<p>More details about "The Mozart Effect" can also be found at <a href="http://lrs.ed.uiuc.edu/students/lerch1/edpsy/mozart_effect.html" rel="nofollow">http://lrs.ed.uiuc.edu/students/lerch1/edpsy/mozart_effect.html</a> where, in particular, the following two paragraphs about the relevant studies seem to help to answer the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He later joined two other researchers, Frances Rauscher and Katherine Ky, in creating the study that coined the term "Mozart Effect". In the October 14, 1993, issue of "Nature" they published a short summary of the findings from their experiment. They assigned thirty six Cal-Irvine students to one of three groups, and offered the same "pretest" to each of the students. One group then listened to a selection by Mozart (Sonata in D major for Two Pianos, K488). A second group listened to what was called a "relaxation tape," and the third group was subjected to ten minutes of silence. All of the students were given the same test, which was designed to measure spatial IQ. This test is described as mentally unfolding a piece of paper is that has been folded over several times and then cut. The object is to correctly select the final unfolded paper shape from five examples. The students who listened to the Mozart sonata averaged an 8&endash;9 point increase in their IQ as compared to the average of the students who had listened to the relaxation tape or who had experienced silence. The increase in IQ of the Mozart group was transitory, lasting only about the time it took to take the test-- from ten to fifteen minutes. </p>
  
  <p>This test stirred enough interest in the academic community to induce several other research teams to conduct similar experiments, with disparate results.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, the media played a big hand in the creation of the misinformation, according to the interview, when they used Dr. Rauscher's explanations out of context to the point of mis-quoting her as concluding that <em>rock music is bad</em> when what she really said was that she hadn't conducted any studies on rock music (she did get a free T-Shirt from the famous rock group <em>Nirvana</em> though, with all the band members' signatures on it as appreciation for the free publicity).</p>
