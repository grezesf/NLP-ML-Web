            <p>I think that "Exploit derivatives" are a very promising form of market to explore, to achieve exactly what you're talking about.  They give researchers a way to make money by discovering a vulnerability without having to disclose it in a dangerous way.  As Rainer BÃ¶hme writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>consider a contract that pays its owner the sum of 100 EUR on, say, 30 June 2006 if there exists a remote root exploit against a precisely speciï¬ed version of ssh on a deï¬ned platform. It is easy to issue this kind of contacts, since you would sell it as a bundle with the inverse contract that pays 100 EUR if the ssh program is not broken within the maturity. Then, diï¬erent parties can trade the contracts on a electronic trading platform that matches bid and ask prices, settles the deals, and publishes the price quotes.</p>
  
  <p>[This kind of market would attract a variety of groups of market participants:]</p>
  
  <p>software users would demand contracts paying on breaches in order to hedge the risks they are exposed to due to their computer network.....</p>
  
  <p>Software vendors could demand contracts that pay if their software remains secure as a means to signal to their customers that they trust their own system; or contracts that pay if their competitorsâ software breaks.....</p>
  
  <p>software vendors [could] use exploit derivatives as part of their compensation schemes to give developers an incentive to secure programming....</p>
  
  <p>Finally, security experts could use the market to capitalize eï¬ort in security analyses. If,
  after a code review, they consider a software as
  secure, they could buy contracts on the secure
  state at a higher rate than the market price.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are an application of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_option" rel="nofollow">Binary options</a>" to security events.  See <a href="http://www.inf.tu-dresden.de/~rb21/publications/Boehme2006_CompVulnMarkets_ETRICS.pdf" rel="nofollow">A Comparison of Market Approaches to Software Vulnerability Disclosure (2006)</a> by Rainer BÃ¶hme, and <a href="http://www.yjolt.org/files/schwalb-9-YJOLT-162.pdf" rel="nofollow">Exploit Derivatives &amp; National Security
</a> by Micah Schwalb for the details.</p>

<p>The main problem seems to be that various laws can be used in various jurisdictions to inhibit the flow of information about vulnerabilities, as Schwalb discusses, so that is something to work on, and he proposes an idea for enabling a pilot by making exceptions to the law for the emerging important but risky world of ipv6 vulnerabilities.</p>
