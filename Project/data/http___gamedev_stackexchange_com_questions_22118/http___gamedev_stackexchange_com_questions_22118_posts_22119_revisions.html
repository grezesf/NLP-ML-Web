            <p> I've actually implemented this just the other day. I started from the XNA Platformer Sample but noticed it had a few problems on corner cases. This was especially noticeable when using it for Zelda-like movement, because the character would get stuck between tiles when hugging the walls in <em>a certain direction</em>. I tried several changes to the algorithm, but there would always be one direction where the problem would appear.</p>

<p> I looked around a bit, and although I was skeptic, ended up trying a simple solution that I read in one forum - and it worked! So, instead of moving the player all at once and then resolving each collision along the smallest axis of intersection depth, the trick was to update and resolve on the X and Y axes separately. The process is still very similar to before, except for that difference. In other words:</p>

<ol>
<li> Apply horizontal velocity to your position.</li>
<li> Round position.X to prevent jittering on some edge cases.</li>
<li> Iterate through each obstacle that the player is intersecting, calculating the horizontal intersection depth and subtracting it from the player's position so that he no longer intersects that obstacle.</li>
<li> Repeat 1-3 but for the vertical axis.</li>
</ol>

<p> And so far it seems to be working, even when trying different player sizes and movement speeds, and "hugging" every wall in every direction. I've also noticed that as long as I cap the maximum instantaneous speed to the smallest value between the player's size and the tile's size, then he won't ever funnel through the walls. And that's still moving pretty fast!</p>

<p> I intended to clean it up a little, maybe make it completely generic, and release on my blog one of these days. But meanwhile I'll just drop every relevant bit of the code in a pastie, albeit unorganized, so you can read through it:</p>

<p><a href="http://pastie.org/3152377" rel="nofollow">http://pastie.org/3152377</a></p>

<p> And <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-D0PGdoDDY" rel="nofollow">here's a little video</a> of that code in action, where I'm forcibly trying to push against every wall. I used normal a player size slightly smaller than the tile, and a normal movement speed, but I've also tested with many different values.</p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><strong><span class="diff-add">Edit</span></strong> </p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><span class="diff-add"> By the way, I'm using a custom method to get the intersection depth (basically the one from the Platformer sample modified to work on 1 dimension at a time) instead of </span><code><span class="diff-add">Rectangle.Intersect</span></code><span class="diff-add">.

            <p> I've actually implemented this just the other day. I started from the XNA Platformer Sample but noticed it had a few problems on corner cases. This was especially noticeable when using it for Zelda-like movement, because the character would get stuck between tiles when hugging the walls in <em>a certain direction</em>. I tried several changes to the algorithm, but there would always be one direction where the problem would appear.</p>

<p> I looked around a bit, and although I was skeptic, ended up trying a simple solution that I read in one forum - and it worked! So, instead of moving the player all at once and then resolving each collision along the smallest axis of intersection depth, the trick was to update and resolve on the X and Y axes separately. The process is still very similar to before, except for that difference. In other words:</p>

<ol>
<li> Apply horizontal velocity to your position.</li>
<li> Round position.X to prevent jittering on some edge cases.</li>
<li> Iterate through each obstacle that the player is intersecting, calculating the horizontal intersection depth and subtracting it from the player's position so that<span class="diff-delete"> it</span><span class="diff-add"> he no</span> longer intersects that obstacle.</li>
<li> Repeat 1-3 but for the vertical axis.</li>
</ol>

<p> And so far it seems to be working, even when trying different player sizes and movement speeds, and "hugging" every wall in every direction.<span class="diff-add"> I've also noticed that as long as</span> I<span class="diff-add"> cap the maximum instantaneous speed to the smallest value between the player's size and the tile's size, then he won't ever funnel through the walls. And that's still moving pretty fast!</span></p><span class="diff-add">

</span><p><span class="diff-add"> I</span> intended to clean it up a little, maybe make it completely generic, and release on my blog one of these days. But meanwhile I'll just drop every relevant bit of the code in a pastie, albeit unorganized, so you can read through it:</p>
