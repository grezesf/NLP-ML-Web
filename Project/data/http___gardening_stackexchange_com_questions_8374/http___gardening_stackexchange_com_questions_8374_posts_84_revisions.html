            <p> I have an avocado plant that has grown indoors since it was a pit. It grew first in a badly insulated, north-facing, wet and cool house, where it grew splendidly. After i moved to a well insulated house with central heating and lots of light, the avocado began to grown sick.</p>

<p> The symptoms were: drying of leaves from the tip to the stalk with wavy patterns on the edge (the remaining green area, gradually reduced, would thus look like a oak leaf).</p>

<p> I first suspected that the drying of leaves meant i had drown the roots, so i gave it less water. Then i read somewhere the symptoms could be a fungus, the only cure for which would be some <em>bouillie Bordelaise</em>, which i prepared and sprayed on the plant.</p>

<p> The next year the avocado grew new leaves, but by the end of summer, they got brown again. By then i thought the problem may have been the atmosphere at home, too dry perhaps. So i sprayed the avocado several times daily to keep it cool and humid. It didn't help either however. </p>

<p> This year i pruned the tree and it grew new sprouts which dried out in turn. It didn't even get the chance to grow them. The dehydratation this year looks different however, it is not brownish, it is dark green and dry.</p>

<p> I'm really confused, i tried many different things and don't really know what to do now. What has caused this change? I can only think of the climate change, but funnily an avocado is a semi-tropical plant from meso-america, it should love sun and heat right? I really am attached to this tree and would like to do my best to help it grow, if you could help i would really be happy for it. Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> 
Here is a picture of a smaller plant which has similar symptoms (the larger one has lost all its leaves):

            <p> I have an avocado plant that has grown indoors since it was a pit. It grew first in a badly insulated, north-facing, wet and cool house, where it grew splendidly. After i moved to a well insulated house with central heating and lots of light, the avocado began to grown sick.</p>

<p> The symptoms were: drying of leaves from the tip to the stalk with wavy patterns on the edge (the remaining green area, gradually reduced, would thus look like a oak leaf).</p>

<p> I first suspected that the drying of leaves meant i had drown the roots, so i gave it less water. Then i read somewhere the symptoms could be a fungus, the only cure for which would be some <em>bouillie Bordelaise</em>, which i prepared and sprayed on the plant.</p>

<p> The next year the avocado grew new leaves, but by the end of summer, they got brown again. By then i thought the problem may have been the atmosphere at home, too dry perhaps. So i sprayed the avocado several times daily to keep it cool and humid. It didn't help either however. </p>

<p> This year i pruned the tree and it grew new sprouts which dried out in turn. It didn't even get the chance to grow them. The dehydratation this year looks different however, it is not brownish, it is dark green and dry.</p>

<p> I'm really confused, i tried many different things and don't really know what to do now. What has caused this change? I can only think of the climate change, but funnily an avocado is a semi-tropical plant from meso-america, it should love sun and heat right? I really am attached to this tree and would like to do my best to help it grow, if you could help i would really be happy for it. Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> 
Here is a picture of a smaller plant which has similar symptoms (the larger one has lost all its leaves):

By then i thought the problem may have been the atmosphere at home, too dry perhaps. So i sprayed the avocado several times daily to keep it cool and humid. It didn't help either however. </p>

<p> This year i pruned the tree and it grew new sprouts which dried out in turn. It didn't even get the chance to grow them. The dehydratation this year looks different however, it is not brownish, it is dark green and dry.</p>

<p> I'm really confused, i tried many different things and don't really know what to do now. What has caused this change? I can only think of the climate change, but funnily an avocado is a semi-tropical plant from meso-america, it should love sun and heat right? I really am attached to this tree and would like to do my best to help it grow, if you could help i would really be happy for it. Thanks<span class="diff-add">.</span></p><span class="diff-add">

                <p> I have an avocado plant that has grown indoors since it was a pit. It grew first in a badly insulated, north-facing, wet and cool house, where it grew splendidly. After i moved to a well insulated house with central heating and lots of light, the avocado began to grown sick.</p>

<p> The symptoms were: drying of<span class="diff-delete"> leafs</span> from the tip to the stalk with wavy patterns on the edge (the remaining green area, gradually reduced, would thus look like a oak leaf).</p>

<p> I first suspected that the drying of<span class="diff-delete"> leafs</span> meant i had drown the roots, so i gave it less water. Then i read somewhere the symptoms could be a fungus, the only cure for which would be some <em>bouillie Bordelaise</em>, which i prepared and sprayed on the plant.</p>

<p> The next year the avocado grew new<span class="diff-delete"> leafs</span>, but by the end of summer, they got brown again. By then i thought the problem may have been the atmosphere at home, too dry perhaps. So i sprayed the avocado several times daily to keep it cool and humid. It didn't help either however. </p>
